I have two problems: first, it moves too easily from science as a generic activity all people engage in, to science as a specifically Western project.  Second, although there has been progress in science in that there is some accumulation of knowledge, the history of science is rather more complicated than that.

One way to deal with this (if others find my criticisms valid) is to distinguish in the article between what we know about changes in scientific method and knowledge (from Aristotle to Bacon to Comte to Popper; from Aristotle to Darwin to Mendel to Mayr; from Aristotle to Newton to Einstein and Planck; etc, on the one hand, and various discussions over how to study and conceive of the history of science (i.e. issues in historiography and the sociology of science), on the other.  For example, I think everyone agrees that Aristotle, Newton, Einstein and Planck are real people who lived at different periods of time and made different claims about the world  but I think different people have vastly different ways of telling the story that connects these people and their claims.

The phrase 'It distorts economies because it punishes productive people for being productive' in relation to progressive taxation does rather assume that people who are more productive get paid more. This does not neccesarily hold true, even if production is defined as contribution to the creation of wealth. It is certainly not true if production is defined as the creation of value.

BSbL29JFbLODIZ5OZTcOh1q5Emg=,""":In an interpreted language your source code is read in command by command by a software tool, which is called the Interpreter and executed.

What ? Command-by-command ? No interpreter is using such crappy technique nowadays. Taw

 From Interpreted Language/Talk 
 
some languages (like Perl) are compiled at runtime

Could you elaborate ? Taw

Every time a perl script is run, Perl compiles it and then runs the compiled code. At least, this is the usual way of using perl, although it's not the only way. Zundark, 2001 Dec 15

You mean compile to syntactic tree or compile to machine code ? Taw

 I believe it's compiled to bytecode, much like Java. As of perl 5.6 (version?), it's possible to produce a bytecode version of a perl program to save the compilation step. I think the bytecode can be converted back to full source as well, but I'm not as sure about that. Indigo Perl (http://www.indigoperl.com) produces a perl compiler that produces a machine executable, but I think the resulting executable consists of both the actual bytecode and enough of the perl engine to run the bytecode, so they tend to be rather large. Their advantage is being able to deploy the code to machines that don't necessarily have the Perl interpreter installed.  They have versions for both Windows and Unix-ish platforms.  Wesley

 Old Interpreted Language article 

An interpreted language is a type of programming language that is not compiled into machine code, but is interpreted at run-time by the computer, and translated into machine understandable code as required.

It is often a mistake to refer to a language as either """"interpreted"""" or """"compiled"""", because
most languages can be implemented in either way, and some languages
(like Perl) are compiled at
runtime but behave as if they were interpreted.
Other languages, like Java, may be partially compiled into an
intermediate form which is then interpreted (although that, too, might be compiled).
Some languages, though, are specifically designed to favor interpretation.

An example of an interpreted language is JavaScript.

Is Java interpreted, or what? 

The Java programming language article says:

""""The first implementations of the language used an interpreted virtual machine to achieve portability, and many implementations still do. These implementations produce programs that run more slowly than the fully-compiled programs created by the typical C++ compiler and some later Java language compilers, so the language suffered a reputation for producing slow programs. More recent implementations of the Java VM produce programs that run much faster, using multiple techniques.""""

The Java language is compiled, always.  It is designed as a compiled language, and is implemented as a compiled language.  It is often compiled into bytecode, which is then interpreted (with a virtual machine).  I think the Java language article is correct, but maybe it could be worded better.  LDC

Yes, and you can also compile Jave straight down to machine code if you like. The above claim that it is a mistake to differentiate between interpreted and compiled languages is IMHO incorrect; every language that has an """"eval"""" statement which lets you construct and evaluate statements on the fly can never be cleanly compiled down to machine code; you will always have to embed an interpreter in your compiled code. AxelBoldt

Way too much mess here has been caused by lack of clear definition of """"compiling"""".
It is used in two distinct meanings, as in:
 compiled to machine code (or assembly)
 compiled to byte code/parse tree/some other internal representation

I think it's wrong to call languages that use the second way """"compiled"""". In such case there would be virtually no interpreted language in use - no language uses line-by-line parsing nowadays, all """"compile"""" source to some form of internal representation.

Quote from FOLDOC:
     Compiler

     A program that converts another program
     from some {source language} (or {programming language}) to
     {machine language} (object code).  Some compilers output
     {assembly language} which is then converted to {machine
     language} by a separate {assembler}.

That could be part of the answer. At least, so much can be read in Darwin's original autobiography, which was first published in 1887, esp. in footnotes in the chapter about the development of his own religious convictions. Another reason (also clear from his ab) might be his frequent illnesses, and his zealous drive to publish as much as possible about other biological/zoological fields of research. He was always frustrated he could not do more.Fact is he produced an enormous amount of work!.
A third reason Darwin waited 19 years was that he simply was afraid of being 'prejudiced' (word quoted literally). His theory needed more time to ripen, so to speak. Anyway, maybe this is of some help. Anyone with more knowledge about it,please go ahead.

Copernicus as Ermland Administrator and the Prussian Coin Reform

Nicolaus Copernicus is today world famous as Astronomer, but at home he wore many different hats. Amongst other positions he held, he was Nicolaus Copernicus Thornensis Prussus Mathematicus, the Prussian mathematician from Thorn. 

This really isn't a position, I don't think  he wasn't hired as a city mathemetician.  Also, I think there should at least be some kind of connection for new readers as to how the whole Ermeland/Thorn/Prussia thing works  it is very unhelpful to assume that the reader will know that one is a city, the other a region, the other a principality, etc...

In the Copernicus manustript an entry from December 1603 states in partial ...Nicolai Copernick Canonici Varmiensis, in Borussia Germaniae mathematici...
In what manuscript? this appears to be a random comment, and doesn't make much sense  

Besides being a church canon and administering as physician to his people, Nicolaus Copernicus worked with the other Prussian states on coin reform. 
Again, reference?  What Prussian states?  What does this mean in practical terms?

The situation in Prussia as well as in other parts of Europe in the years before, during and after the Reformation became very insecure and confused. 
Copernicus died in 1543  well before the Peace of Augsburg  Although this statement is correct, I'm not sure how Copernicus the church canon, physician, astronomer, etc., fits in.  

There were cities in Prussia that fought for keeping the government of the Catholic Teutonic Knights and others, who fought to get the Papal domination out and to become Protestant. During this time the crown of Poland, held by the Lithuanian Jagiello’s, married to the imperial Habsburg's had some limited influence in the politics of Prussia. Sigismund I wanted the Prussian cities to give up their right to mint coins. The leading cities of Prussia, Thorn, Danzig and Elbing declared, never would they give up their individual city rights to mint coins. Minting coins was a right given by the emperor and giving up this right would mean loss of sovereignty . 

This helps to explain something about the former, in that it sets up a Catholic-Protestent conflict.  My questions: 

What cities, if any, were ruled by the Teutonic Knights at the time  or was it all of Prussia?  
Does this have something to do with either the Second treaty of Thorn or the abdication of Albrecht of Prussia from his position as Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights?  From the other info on the site, it looks like there may have been some conflict over jurisdiction between Albrecht and his heirs and the TKs, who began to get their Grand Masters by imperial appointment (and from the impreial  read Habsburg  family)
How do the Jagiellos fit in?  Is their involvement because of their distant connection to the Habsburgs, as Helga implies?  or because (as we know from other articles) at one point, residents of the area had appealed to the Polish rulers for help in overthrowing the Teutonic Knights?
'''Could the objections of the cities mentioned not have something to do with their being members of the Hansa  a group notoriously jealous of their independence and privileges?  In answer to the much-anticipated imperial comment, viz., that the objections had  to do with an infringement of imperial right and law, I cry bullshit.

 To attempt to briefly several of Ed's questions from what I can only hope is an Eastern Orthodox Christian POV:
 * Nothing """"compels"""" a just God to """"enforce"""" a person's separation from Him, save the principle of the person's free will. If a person chooses not to love God, or chooses a life separate from God, that amounts to the same as choosing death, since they are cutting themselves off from the ultimate source of life. Looking at the word """"perish"""" in John 3:16, in Greek it is in neither active nor passive voice, but rather """"middle voice"""", which means a better translation would be """"whoever does not believe in him will destroy himself"""". Living in the presence of an all-loving God while rejecting that love is how some Orthodox theologians describe Hell; hence, God's love is sometimes described as a """"river of fire"""". Hence both God's goodness and justice are preserved, as well as each person's free will.
 * Also, Jesus did not have to die. To say that he was forced to die would imply that some external force or law is greater than God and forced God to act against His will. Eastern Orthodoxy has always rejected this notion, and rather says that Jesus chose to lay down his life in order trample down death by death. When Death tried to swallow up the the Giver of Life, Death's power was overcome. As for alternative plans, none are discussed, but that's not the same as saying that God had no choice or was compelled by something or someone else. Some Church Fathers speak of Christ triumphantly mounting the Cross like a steed.
 * The Jews did not have to accept Jesus as their Messiah. He simply was their Messiah; it was not an elected office, and their choices did not change this fact, did not prevent his triumphant death or his resurrection. Many Jews did believe in him, many more did not.
 Hope this helps. I'll have to look another time at whether or how any of this should affect the article, as I'm obviously coming in very late to an old discussion.  17:15 Sep 9, 2002 (UTC)"""
Q+IhSWjFDsCoHo6d6XqJZhgv7q8=," On the fringes of any nation the melting pot effect is less pronounced. The homogenisation of England did not permeate beyond the Tamar into the Cornish peninsular until the later half of the 19th century, and it is this fact that gives rise to a separate Cornish identity. In the rest of England the Celtic identity of the Britons was subsumed by the waves of Anglo-Saxon, Danish and Norman invasions, but the King on the throne of England has been the Cornish people’s overlord for some 1200 years. Even so, the Cornish language aside (of which there has not been one native speaker for 150 years), I wonder if this identity is any really any stronger that that of Yorkshire. A Yorkshireman has a distinct identity different from much of England but very few would not claim England to be the nation of their birth.

In the 19th century a Cockney and a Geordie meeting for the first time would have found great difficulty communicating, though they were speaking the same tongue, but both would have been sure they were living in England. England was until relatively recently a land of containing many regional identities and has only relatively recently started to become a blurry single entity. What is England and Englishness anyway? Is it drinking tea?, or eating roast beef?, or playing cricket? or a sense of fair play?, or belief in trial by jury?, or a particular sense of humour? If it is anyone of these I don’t see how the Cornish differ from the English.

Leaving aside these philosophical issues and returning to the realpolitik as sjc calls it the situation is clear. The Cornish nation ceased to exist some 1200 years ago and the duchy of Cornwall is irrelevant to the governmental administration of the region. It is administered by a county council fairly elected by the inhabitants many of whom are happy to call themselves English. Some are not, but some Scots nationalists dislike being called British, the fact remains that Scotland is in Britain (UK) similarly those Cornish people may dislike being called English cannot get away from the fact that as it stands Cornwall remains a county in England until a Cornish nation is re-established. Despite the aspirations of Cornish nationalists/separatists and despite the anachronistic state of affairs regarding the Duchy of Cornwall, Cornwall is currently a county in England and to fail to describe it as such is simply erroneous. It would be a misrepresentation of the facts to state otherwise. 

As for the arguments regarding the specific wording of this article, as long as it continues to state that 'Cornwall is a county of Great Britain' or similar avoidance of the words 'county in England', new readers will contineu to try to correct it back to 'county in England' because rightly or wrongly, that's what everybody apart from a small minority (and as far as Wikipedia is concerned I think it's a minority of one), perceive it to be. 00:41 Sep 10, 2002 (UTC)"

Perhaps it would make sense to move some of the stuff from Terrorism against Arabs back here, if we came to having 2 distinct articles once again? For instance, Lord Moyne was not much of an Arab (though they were his favorites, I guess), so his assassination by Stern gang belongs more to Israeli terrorism Uriyan

 Facts about Israel (note that many of the statements on this page are disputed)

With all the due respect, I don't think this link should be applied on this page, for several reasons:
 It is not about Israeli terrorism, but about general Israel-bashing
 It contains mostly incomplete and partial information. For instance, the green Palestinian number plates was something they asked for. Israeli Arabs have regular yellow plates, and because of that are sometimes targeted by Palestinian gunmen.
 Many of these statements deserve a proper discussion, in Wikipedia, not out of it.  Uriyan

The USS Liberty incident is generally thought to have been an Israeli mistake.

 The USS Liberty was a US Navy ship. It was flying a Navy ensign. It had guns on it. Since it wasn't civilian, engaging it at sea does not have anything to do with terrorism, and has no place on this page, which is about terrorism. Uriyan

 Uriyan

This sentence has been removed from the article about Kach. """"They have also organized murders and beatings of Palestinians in the U.S.""""
 Really?  Who?  

I too am curious about this claim. It is so vague and undocumented that it does not belong in the article. Can someone provide specific claims, and a few sources for us to check out? Also, I do not understand what this has to do with the government of Israel. I agree that it is theoretically possible for a few fanatic right-wing American Jews to carry out such a thing. But (A) there is only a vague allegation being made, and (B) this has nothing to do with the Israeli government, nor the pre-Israel proto-state in the British Mandate of Palestine. We can't simply lump all crimes done by Jewish people into the category of """"Israeli terrorism"""". All crimes committed by Arabs considered Palestinian terrorism (No.). 

Unless these acts were committed by agents of the government of Israel, why are they listed as """"Israeli terrorism"""" instead of """"Jewish terrorism""""?  ~~

I'd tend to agree with Zoe here about the title of the article being wrong. Since it's so """"controversial"""" coming up with a universally-acceptable definition of """"terrorist"""" vs. """"freedom fighter"""", maybe we should just have """"Violence against Israelis"""" and """"Violence against Palestinians"""" pages, or some such?

 Such pages exist (at least for Palestinians), but nobody bothers to update them. It's much less sexy than """"Israeli terrorism"""". 

Then maybe this should redirect to """"Violence against Palestinians"""" (after moving the content of this page & its Talk there, of course)?

The page I had in mind was Palestinians killed by Israelis, but I support leaving """"X terrorism"""" pages, because of the difference between spontaneous violence and pre-calculated killing, which is terrorism. 

Actually, I was thinking of very neutral titles (such as the """"violence"""" ones above), chucking in all the text from any non-NPOV-titled articles scattered about (they can be smoothed out later) and redirecting to the neutral-titled articles. It should make NPOV easier to maintain. I'd lose the """"terrorism"""" pages entirely in the process (dumping their text & talk into the new articles), as we're never going to agree on which acts are """"terrorism"""" and which are not (and you know we're not, yeah?). If the articles just give the facts then we can leave """"terrorism or not?"""" decisions up to the readers.

 Having considered the concept, I support it. In the text itself, we would then have the freedom to describe which actions exactly can be considered terrorism and by whom. 

(bloody hell, did we just agree on something, Uri? Will wonders never cease?)

 Yes, we did agree, and I'm glad at it. I hope it'll be a good beginning for tomorrow - I've got to log out now.

Everything is important in math, specially in a number theory. If I wouldn't use Möbius function I wouln't be able to find those two numbers 648 and 700. I guess here μ(n) is 'more' important than other arithmetic functions. That's my opinion. Furthermore, anyone interested in the moebius function can easily find the value, since all they have to do is to count the prime factors, which are already given in the table. Yes, that is true.

Twigs are critically important in species identification.  I'll edit the separate branch and twig articles later to make sure this is reflected.

Feel free to discuss your questions directly with me by email if you like (wiki lets you do this by clicking a link). I used a variety of references obtained via Google, which I did not list in the article (I probably should have).

I have doubts about some of the information that was there before my changes and that you have restored. In particular, I believe that Skene's glands are not the same as the G-spot, and are not located there. However, stimulation of the G-spot can cause female ejaculation, which generates fluid from the Skene's glands (among other tissues).

By the way, your contributions to Wikipedia are impressive.

h7h/drPlasLnrDoUHOK5njgYRqI=,"Let me respond again.

I usually get a l lot of negative reaction when I introduce something with which lay readers are not familiar. 

I don’t have a pro-dictator bias. It just seems like that because I’m correcting articles that were already one-sided. History's not a pros and cons analysis anyway. Historians want to know why and how. 

Also, I don’t use one explanatory model (like Marxism, World Systems Theory, Dependency Theory, Modernization Theory, etc.) solely. I don’t keep my mind closed to one interpretation. 

If an article chronicles any facts, I leave them if they’re accurate. But they must be explained in a context. Statements like ‘he’s an authoritarian dictator bent on staying in power at all cost rejected by the international community’ will go in favor of statements like ‘because of his controversial policies he’s been ejected from the Commonwealth at Britain’s behest'. 

If an article mentions that Mugabe has been seizing white-owned farms it must also mention that 4,500 white farmers own 70% in the land in a country of 13 million. The article must also explain why land reform is a touted goal in the Third World. To many, that unacceptable because that's pro-Mugabe POVing. But quoting anti-Mugabe insults by as many famous people as possible is possible because it's a fact that they said those things. 

Some can’t tolerate that. To them, Mugabe persecutes homosexuals; he’s a racist; he subverts democracy; he cracks down against NGOs; he rigs elections; he’s unmitigated evil; and he does that because he’s evil. 

There are not that many social historians who would accept such simplistic, sweeping conclusions based on superficialities. "

James was James VI of Scotland long before he became James I of England. So everyone agreed that that was the order they should be in. But in typical SM/DF style it was decided, 'screw everyone else's agreement, I am going to unilaterally change it. (Like Adam tried to screw up naming conventions, and even when voted down still ignored the decision and did it Adam's way, leaving everyone else to rename articles and clear up the mess by returning things to the agreed formula. 

Second, there was a long long long debate about when to describe a modern monarch as British. It was agreed to apply it to after 1707. But Adam decided to ignore the long debate and do it his way, his way on the naming of election pages (who cares if everyone else uses a totally different system and votes down his suggestion!), his way on referring to peers, his way on using the word British, on how to describe James VI/I, his way now on the History of the Soviet Union, his way on how names on a list should appear (the different way to everyone else's, he unilaterally changing lists to suit what he wanted, even when everyone else screamed 'what the hell are you doing'.  Other people put a lot of work into getting a consensus. Adam ignores the consensus and does it the way he wants. And gets miffed when people end up undoing his garbled stuff and return things to the agreed way.

Yes there has been an improvement, cp. DF was actually nice to work with for about 4 days, then suddenly became an ogre on idolatory and various other pages. The immediate reaction was 'oh God, here we go again'. Even Mav let out a sigh about DF's behaviour, and Mav doesn't normally do that.

To me, the SI's dismissal of Black Mask seems like a ideal example of rigor but I suspect we'd disagree about a lot. I'll boil the general argument down to the point that the intended mission of wikipedia is producing a neuteral summary of generally agreed facts about historically significant actors, in this case the SI. The question of Debord's dictatorial control is clearly a partisan position, therefore it should hardly be presented prominently (though it's certainly a fact the many have claimed this). The split with the Nashists was *A* significant event during period of development of the Situationists. But to call it *THE* significant event is to make earlier development of group more important than the latter development. Debord and Sanguinetti's book """"The Real Split In The International"""" could just as well be called the """"fundamental split"""" if you took later Situationist developments as more important. Naturally, a neuteral account would take neither position - it could still mention one or both. 
Your claims that my lack of interest in the Nashists represent anti-Scandinavians racism might perhaps be considered another instance of your humor, perhaps? In anycase, the studies of the SI that come to mind are Sadie Plant or Len Bracken. Even Greil Marcus has some useful stuff. Indeed, in the clearly partisan Bob Black essay the introductory paragraphs still winds-up with a somewhat more balanced view of the group than the current entry here (though clearly there's still a """"revive the honor of forgotten Second Situationist Internation"""" thing going on). 
In anycase, I reviewed the history of text and it seem that the first or two paragraphs are essentially tacked-on afterwards. This explains the disjointed quality of the text as a whole - it clearly needs rewriting. 
As far as links go, certainly inclusive links are another option - it is simply that the entry would have to be vastly MORE inclusive than the present entry if you wanted to include all links to comments and critiques on the Situationists.

You just got caught in the crossfire, and if I made you think I was thinking of you I apologise. Your work is consistent good plus even more importantly, you have a sensitivity to other people's work with a few people don't. You build on their work to produce something that improves in quality. The people I was talking about arrive at an article, chop it around, change meanings, change context, spelling, capitalisation and then move on, more often than not without giving the slightest suggestion that they actually knew what they were doing. 

For example, one guy when he comes across the word taoisigh which is the gaelic plural for taoiseach and which is explained as such on its first mention in some articles, frequently changes it to taoiseachs, a non-existent word. He has tried to change governors-general to governor-generals, Prime Minister to Prime minister. He changed links from President of Ireland to President of Ireland, links to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (ie the form of UK between 1901 and 1922) to United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, so linking the reference to the wrong UK. He mucked up some links to Tánaiste (deputy Irish prime minister) by lower-casing it, changed a series of mentions of First Lady when referring to a specific first lady to lowercase first lady, changed one mention of Garret FitzGerald to Garrett Fitzgerald, removed the word Óg from Gearóid Og Fitzgerald and Mór from Gearóid Mór Fitzgerald, not grasping that they actually were two different people (Mór = big in gaelic and indicated the father, Óg meaning small meant his son) and ended up turning an article that mentioned them both into gobbledigook. That is just some of my work he has mucked up. He made a complete mess of some biology articles, reduced an article on mediæval history to such a degree of unreadability that the author, one of the world's top mediæval historians, quick wiki in disgust. I know at least six people who have left wiki over his actions. And there are quite a few such people. Not a lot, but enough to mangle everything they touch. Another contributor constantly changed an elementary fact in 18th century history on the basis of google searches. I checked on google. The majority of articles said he was right. Those google searches turned up stuff that were barely of high school standard. But she treated google as sacrosanct. If a google search said it, it was gospel. 

I have had political science articles which I have written and which were based on hard fact, in mediocre garbage, applying wrong capitalisation (again based on google searches that largely threw up high school essays), wrong spelling, wrong interpretation, etc. I wasn't reacting simply to the Droop Quota at all (that was the sixth article that day I had done that had been 'hit'. In that case Michael Hardy as he is prone to do, swept in to a topic he knows little about, changed capitalisation, text and even the formula which is the standard DQ formula taught (in that form because as already happened in the discussion on the talk page, if you leave out the parentheses people muck up the order of the calculation and so get the wrong formula). That intervention was classic Michael; go onto a page about a topic he doesn't know much about and instead of asking why it is written like that, unilaterally change it, in most cases producing a version that is so wrong it would be savaged if any student repeated it in a class.

American english and British English use different approaches to capitalisation. Many of the references were to things only found outside the US and so capitalised. Instead he insisted on applying US capitalisation rules to things whose capitalisation is a result of their existence and usage in parts of the world outside the US. That indeed is one of the reasons why google should never be used in checking capitalisation. Apart from its general unreliability, most website mentions in the US are created by people who automatically and incorrectly apply US capitalisation to things that don't exist in the US and are capitalised internationally. A classic example is the electoral system PR.STV (Proportional Representation using the Single Transferable Vote). Michael insisted on lowercasing it on the basis on a google search. PR.STV isn't used in the US and is generally capitalised when referring to the specific voting system, and lowercased when used generically. Where it is mentioned on google, it is largely on the basis of Americans writing about it and downcasing it to suit American english. So Michael unilaterally mucked up the capitalisation, then another US user moved the page to another name that refers to a somewhat similar but not the same electoral system more widely known in the US. So any non-American user would get r"

 Poor coins are very worn, and most of the detail of the coin will have gone, but you're still able to tell what type of coin it is.
 Fair coins are well worn, but more of the detail of the coin is visible, and it is easy to identify the coin.
 Good coins will have almost all the lettering readable, and the date will be easy to read in most cases.
 Very Good coins  will have all the coin readable, and some of the finer details of the design can start to be made out.
 Fine coins will have the details of the coins taking shape, and the coin is starting to become collectable if it's fairly recent.
 Very Fine coins will have all the details clear, and there will be wear only on the high points of the design, and most of the fine details shows clearly.
 Extremely Fine coins will have wear on only the highest points of the design.
 Uncirculated coins will have no wear on the high points of the design at all, though faults in the engraving, or wear on the die, may mean that the design may not be fully struck.

 Under no circumstances should collectible coins be cleaned or polished  this will destroy at least half its' collectible value.

Coming back to your 1862 penny, values for a bog-standard penny in UK Pounds, in Britain, are:

VF - GBP 10
EF - GBP 40
UNC - GBP 70

XQDF0Tjny1IPhq4uQaVXobaBbOY=,"International Symposium on Dr Axel Munthe

The second  international symposium on Dr Axel Munthe’s  life and work   will be held  on Saturday 13th of September at Hildasholm, Leksand, Sweden. 

From the Royal College of Physicians in London, Professor Ian McDonald (adjunct Prof Dept. Neurology, Yale University also Prof. Emeritus of Clinical Neurology, University College London will be speaking on the relationship between Dr Axel Munthe and the famous Professor Charcot of the Salpetriere in Paris.

The eminent architect, writers and former curator of Villa San Michele, Levente Erdeos will be giving a talk on “The makings of Villa San Michele, some connections to contemporary art and thinking”

Other distinguished speakers include the Swedish author, Bengt Jangfeldt,Dr Peter Cottino from Capri, Mårten Lindståhl, Sweden, Dr.Katriona Munthe-Lindgren from London, and Prof.Alden Smith, Department of Classics, Baylor University Texas, USA.

When Munthe received his medical degree in Paris in 1880 at the age of 23, he was the youngest Doctor of Medicine in Europe. His thesis was on the subject of gynaecology and obstetrics. Munthe had, however, been deeply impressed by the influential Professor Charcot in the field of neurology, and therefore already at an early stage was greatly interested in general diseases.

In the same year he opened his first practice in Paris, which was frequented mostly by members of the large Scandinavian colony of artists. He lived intermittently in Italy where he helped the cholera-stricken population (1880 on the island of Ischia, 1883 in Naples).

In 1887 Axel Munthe left Paris and settled in Anacapri where he worked as general practitioner. In 1890 he opened a practice in Rome where he was consulted by foreign dignitaries resident in Rome, as well as by Italian patients. He was appointed physician to the royal Swedish household to care for Crown Princess Victoria, later queen, from 1892 until her death in 1930.

During the First World War Axel Munthe served as a physician in the British Red Cross at the front in France. He described his activities in the book, Red Cross & Iron Cross, which was published in London in 1916.

Axel Munthe became a legendary physician who always gave free medical treatment to the poor. For some time he maintained a hospice for elderly, destitute people in a castle outside Rome. He was an outstanding psychologist who was extremely restrictive in prescribing treatment by drugs. The preferred forms of treatment prescribed by Munthe included hypnosis and therapy through music.

The Story of San Michele entirely overshadows all other publications by Axel Munthe, although it includes much of what he had already written earlier. His very first publications covered a number of travel discourses which appeared in the Stockholm newspaper, Stockholms Dagblad, and which described his experiences of relief work during the cholera epidemic in Naples. These discourses came out in book form in Sweden in 1885, in England in 1887, and later in 1910 in Italy. Subsequently he wrote a number of other papers and short stories which were later collected and published: for example, Små Skizzer, published in Stockholm in 1888; Vagaries, London 1898; Memories and Vagaries, London 1908; Bref och Skizzer, Stockholm 1909; En gammal bok om manniskor och djur, Stockholm 1931; Vagabondaggio, Milan 1933; Ein altes Buch von Menschen und Tieren, Leipzig 1934, etc.

Hildasholm, the house that Axel Munthe built for his bride in 1910-1911, was designed by the architect Torben Grut (who would later create the Stockholm stadium). It lies amongst the trees on the edge of Lake Siljan in the heart of Dalarna.

 Surrounded by gardens and pine woods it looks over the peaceful
waters and comprises Swedish, English and Italian furniture and paintings
from the 17th, 18th and 19th century Europe. It is still used by the family
while also being opened as a museum for the public during the summer
months. 

The gardens were created by Axel’s wife Hilda on the promontories
and in the ravines surrounding the house where suddenly the well ordered
English garden breaks into the wild and romantic natural environment.

Freud's ideas are certainly much discussed today, and I would be the first to agree that they must be grappled with and dealt with seriously, if only because of their currency.  So Freud deserves a long and thorough article in Wikipedia.  I believe that a balanced article would include A) explanations of Freud's theories, and B) the status of Freudianism today.  The existing article is quite thorough on """"A"""" and had almost nothing on """"B"""".  A neophyte who read the article as it stood a month ago would imagine that Freud's work has the same relation to current psychology that Darwin's work has to current biology.  

Let's compare them:  Darwinism thoroughly permeates modern biology, and his fundamentals, built on copious observation and collegial collaboration, now much extended with new data and new theories, continue to provide accurate predictions and fruitful avenues of exploration.  Freud's fundamental ideas were founded on minimal and dubious observations, and his theories do not meet the test of being logical, minimal, reproducible explanations of the data.  As far as Jung goes, I haven't gotten to him yet  ), and I don't know anything about Maslow.  Freud draws my fire precisely because he is so high profile, so influential, and so wrong.  I was required to study The Interpretation of Dreams in high school as if it were scientific fact, and the disgust I felt when I later realized it was all as stupid as it sounded has turned me into - yes - a Freud critic.  Of course, I am striving for NPOV.  Do you really feel that presenting Freud's pseudoscience without comment is NPOV, whereas quoting one of many eminent critics is not?   21:55, 14 Sep 2003 (UTC)"""

pgqzWtukvWTTf5w6Y7Sa26lHpjQ=,"military equipment and tactics then?  It's hard to just talk about a weapon without talking about how it is used.  

A three-level abstraction is required here.  We have the history and strategy which are inseparable, and should be discussed in articles on each war or conflict.  That's the most abstract.  Then we need the least abstract military equipment and tactics level, with articles like military technology during the Napoleonic wars and so forth, to make it clear how conflicts were conducted using this stuff - this should focus on the actual tactical combat engagements, how they affected outcomes, etc..

And, for those wars that resulted in a great deal of change to military technology, either because they were very long (like the Hundred Years' War) or very intense (like WWI or WWII), we should discuss technological escalation as a separate topic, more abstract than the equipment and tactics, less abstract than history and strategy.  See technological escalation during WWI for an example - this can be done for WWII, US Civil War, Napeolonic wars, at least, as well, and maybe also for the Cold War.  This gets into the mechanics of how things changed, how they thought, etc., and really isn't the same topic as either history/strategy or equipment/tactics for the guys on the ground using  the equipment to perform the tactics."

Because I am pretty new to this project and was invited by the Wikipedia policy just to step in and make some edits, I would like apologize for failing to communicate with you effectively, and to clarify a couple of things:

1) I have made in the recent days some substantial contributions and modifications to the Silesia article that I felt would be valuable to the internet readers. I din't expect that some of this changes will meet with such a fierce resistance.

2) These contributions were based on my deep knowledge (in my opinion) and serious studies into the history and modern times of Silesia. My intention was to write about facts and not about opinions, and to avoid any nationalistic bias of any kind.

3) I am very seriously touched that people who introduce most of the chaos and natiolistic bias to this article are the first to accuse others of vandalism and extreme nationalism.

 20:45, 26 Oct 2003 (UTC)

 My suggestion: let's write what Silesia is now 

The Silesia article DO need some serious improvement if we want it to be the valuable and reliable resource for the internet users. The current (restored and protected) version contains so many errors that it will chase away people with basic historical knowledge, if it's not changed as soon as possible.

1) First I suggest that we write what Silesia is now (as this is most interesting to the reader), and not what is was in the past. Silesia rich history should be discussed in the history section.

2) It is unacceptable to state that Silesia lies between Odra and Vistula rivers. First look at any map will show you that Silesia lies along the Odra river.

3) Silesia lies today in Poland and Czech Republic. It is doubtful if the Goerlitz area is part of Silesia. It is a historical part of Lusatia, and was joined to the Silesian province after 1816.

4) Im my opinion we should not discuss Silesian history in the intro paragraph, but we decide to, it is unacceptable to mention only the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation

5) I do not care in what order the language-names of Silesia are mentioned, but I do insist that the Silesian version (Ślónsk, Ślunsk) is included in this list. 

6) I do insist that the various nationalities and ethnic groups living know in SIlesia, are mentioned clearly and the list should include at least: the Silesians, the Poles, the Germans, the Czechs

7) The theories about the name of the region must be clearly marked as theories and not as facts. The passages need some minor rewrite.

8) The remarks about HRE overlordship in 1146 and 1163 are simply false, no longer upheld by the German historians, and must be removed

9) Great care must be taken when dealing with Silesian history, for example the rude remarks about devastation was caused by Hussite rebellion must be rewritten using neutral words

10) The Silesia article need more sections on the People, Economy, Culture, Education, Science and Tourism.

If ten days elapse and fewer than 3 people or a majority want to undelete, the page remains deleted. When a sysop undeletes an article, they should list the article on Wikipedia:Votes for deletion.

Pfortuny on Pfortuny's mediation

Apologies for the delay and for the following text which is far too long and I think out of place, but the discussion has led us here. By no means I intend my opinion to be regarded as more important than any other's, but for obvious reasons some people are expecting it. Here it goes. The history of this text is in  15:09, 14 Nov 2003 (UTC)

After reviewing the history and talking to , I have got the following vision of the facts (which is the basis for my opinion expressed below):
Alex's editions on the 29 were done without discussion on the talk page. This was clearly a serious mistake which led to the first catastrophe, but I think we may assume good faith here, at least ingnorance, not malice, especially if one follows the summaries, diffs, etc... 
Alex's editions on the 9 and 10 November were done using the talk page but he made edits before discussing them and, given the complete history of the article, the edits were too bold to be accepted without previous discussion; this led to their being systematically reverted (which is common use in the WP for that behaviour) and in the end to the blocking of the page. This behaviour was clearly a mistake of Alex's, and I put it to his not having read the complete history. While I am not excusing him, I do believe that most of the problems were a result of confusion caused by his Asperger's Syndrome.
Nobody can agree """"not to make unilateral edits"""" (Adam's expression) in whatever page for whatever reason, this is a bit too generic and has no deadline.
He is aware of the damages he may incur in (damages for himself) if he repeats the above behaviour.
Before Viajero's suggestion, Alex had told me he was going to """"try to stay out of Mother Teresa's page for a while"""". He has privately told me he is not going to touch the criticism section al least for a fortnight.
It sounds nice to be a mediator, but on the other hand it is a responsibility I cannot (I mean cannot, not do not want to or do not like to) take up for the moment.
If Alex behaves like he did on the 9/10 November, I will also agree to any rational punishment. I want to stress that I was in disagreement with most of his edits.
I do not think that Alex will cause any further problems.

Before stating my opinion, I would like everybody to know that Viajero's suggestion on my mediation was done without either mine or Alex's prior consent. He later expressed his concern about this to me. I feel it is only fair to mention it here.

Hence, my opinion is:
Unblock the page. If Alex behaves in a non cooperative way, then the resources of Wikipedia to prevent this non cooperative behaviour will be used, as with any other user.

But I mean as with any other user. If he were going to appear in the problem page, he has to be told in his talk page in advance; if he were going to be banned, then he has to be told explicitly in his own page and by a sysop, or whatever the standard procedure is.  12:35, 14 Nov 2003 (UTC)

The first paragraph of the article ends with:

The term racialism is sometimes favored as a less negative term by those who hold certain beliefs about race that they believe to be scientifically justified. 

Two problems:

The way this sentence is currently worded, it assumes the validity of the concept of race, when in fact that term is problematical because of the way most people interpret it. 

There is no clear indication of what believers in """"racialism"""" believe  other than that they believe their beliefs are scientifically justified. It's also unclear whether these believers are even a reasonably coherent group, or whether for some users of the terms it indicates a belief that, e.g., people with a recent African heritage are more likely, statistically, to have sickle-cell anemia and therefore need to be screened for that disease, and for others it is just a cosmetic improvement on """"racism.""""

It has 20 population clusters, but only captures 18% of the variation in the haplotypes. (That is, many of the haplotypes are spread in various ways amongst the identified groups. The details are given in a table in the paper.)

Underhill et al did not have adequate data on New Guinea and Australia, and so created a single group for them all. It looks as though they may have missed some interesting areas altogether.

In the following:

    * """"X, Y"""" means X and Y are leaves that are directly joined together;
    * A+B is just the name of a single group. 

The tree has three main lobes (A,B,C):

The question as to descent could be answered rather well via DNA testing of their Priests and Levites  as well as mitochrondrial DNA testing. But there is risk, the desired results might not be obtained. 

Would this meet the need:

The Samaritans have insisted that they are direct descendants of the Northern Israelite tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, who survived the destruction of the Northern kingdom of Israel by the Assyrians in 722 B.C.E. The inscription of Sargon II records the deportation of a relatively small proportion of the Israelites (27,290, according to the annals), so it is quite possible that a sizable population remained that could identify themselves as Israelites, the term that the Samaritans prefer for themselves.

Samaritan historiography would place the basic schism from the remaining part of Israel after the twelve tribes conquered the land of Canaan, lead by Joshua. After Joshua's death, Eli the priest left the tabernacle which Moses erected in the desert and established on Mount Gerizim, and built another one under his own rule in the hills of Shilo (1 Sam 1:1-3; 2:12-17). Thus, he established both an illegitimate priesthood and an illegitimate place of worship.

Signing is done when you are editing a 'talk' page. When you are having a discussion it really helps to know who said what, and when. We always encourage people to sign whatever they write there. However in articles everything is considered 'common property'. We don't sign what we write, because we don't want to think that we 'own' it in any way; someone might come along and change it later. Once an article has been in existence for more than a few days there are usually many people who have contributed to it. In some cases there may be nothing left of what the first author wrote.

What a lot of people do is put a list of articles that they have made big contributions to on their own user page. That gives you an idea of what a person has done here without claiming 'ownership'.

 Copied from Blue Ball 
(The issues of this language are unrelated to disambiguation, but should be consistent with the article Blue balls.)

The following appears on Blue Ball but is more efficient to discuss here:
""""Blue balls"""" is a modern slang term for a minor cramping men may get in the groin after they are sexually stimulated for a prolonged period but do not ejaculate.
(t) 21:28, 2004 Mar 16 (UTC)

Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary conforms to common sense usage in saying a cramp is """"a painful spasmodic muscular contraction"""", and the groin does have muscles.  But blue balls is not a cramp, but an ache in the testicles (whose musculature is insignificant at most).  Ellis emphasizes """"congestion"""", which i take to imply that the pain reflects failure to release the eleveated local blood pressure resulting from failure to relieve the engorgement of the genitals that is crucial to erection, i.e., a condition related to the """"pain and tenderness"""" of priapism.  (It may be informative to consult side-effects information of Viagra and its competitors, some of which are effective for 3 days and advise medical care for erections lasting over 4 hours.) (t) 21:28, 2004 Mar 16 (UTC)

Further, the term ejaculate, like the earlier """"release semen"""" (that a well-intentioned editor  used to replace simply """"release""""), misleadingly suggests that fluid pressure of seminal fluid is at issue; i think research will show that there is no significant seminal pressure except that imposed in pulses by the prostate during ejaculation.  The real issue is indeed plain """"release"""", or rather release of either sympathetic or parasympathetic (never could remember which is which) nervous-system excitation, which in turn entails destimulation of sphincter-like structures that sustain the engorgement (and that ED-medications work by affecting).

Hence it is ludicrous to quote Faisal Husseini calling for """"the liberation of all Palestine from the river to the sea"""" without placing it within the governing geopolitical reality: Israel is armed to the teeth, backed by the even more powerful USA, and has between 200 and 400 nuclear warheads.

OK, when I refreshed my memory by looking at a map, I realized that Elliott Bay and Lake Washington squeezing in in the middle is probably at least 60% of the problem, so I generalized it some, although it's now a little wordier. Basically, at least for a straight road (ie following the grid), it's pretty much limited to the area of the Montlake Cuta street between Lake Union and Portage Bay would run into the Duwamish, adding the cost of a second bridge.
And, indeed, if you include Lake City Way, and MLK Way, 23rd/25th does indeed come closest to qualifying (as connecting N boundary to S). (I don't feel strongly about having the explanation here, I just added it to answer the question that I thot many readers would have.)

As for Madison being the only E<>W, the offset downtown grid doesn't help, bodies of water play a part, tho' not as much (even tho' the Duwamish is generally narrow enuf for a bridge, there aren't going to be many built). Hills probably do make up most of the rest of the reason (at least besides the fact the probably no one really made it a goal). I assume the reason Madison does is related to the ferry it used to serve that crossed Lake Washington, tho' I don't know offhand which came first. (Yesler probably would also be one, except the for the hill on the east end.)

PS I like your additions to the layout article (I don't have any Seattle/King County street maps down here [but ordered a King Co Thomas Guide earlier today], so I was mostly going from memory about which cities, although I should have remembered Shoreline, since I lived there a few years, and Mercer Island, since my dad worked there about 20 yrs), and THANK YOU for fixing """"road label""""I knew it was bad, but was having a mental block as to how to fix it. Oh, and leaving out """"numbering"""" there is fine.

PPS Turns out the road preceded the ferry, which wasn't planned at the time, so they're less connected than I thot. I guess the reason is that the street was made by someone that wanted the connection, and owned enuf land he could do it, and did it back when it was still possible; probably a rare combination.  20:20, 8 Apr 2004 (UTC)"""

Delete with prejudice""""
(Baas)Ya, you're not supposed to let anyone know that you're prejudice or bias.  Then people disregard what you have to say because it's unsubstantiated, by definition. (definition of prejudice)

Also, may I remind you that character attacks are against wikipedia policy.

Also, in a formal debate, character attacks are considered bad form.  And prejudice certainly isn't considered an argument. In fact, it often causes one to believe and say things that are not true, as Wile has pointed out.  16:09, 8 Apr 2004 (UTC)

(Me)Evidently, English is not your mother tongue, so I can forgive you in misunderstanding that """"Delete with prejudice"""" does not refer to you, but to the article. I have spent some time observing your efforts to create articles which lack the barest semblance of connection to current mathematical research, and to be extremely rude to other Wikipedians when they quite reasonably ask for reliable references and sources. What I know of your work tells me that, even if there is some sense to what you posit, it lacks any context with which to connect to contemporary mathematical thought. It therefore constitutes, at best original research, which is explicitly unacceptable here, and at worst, what I will call delusional thought. It therefore has, in my opinion, no place in Wikipedia at this time, if ever. As I said earlier, call us after the Nobel is awarded.

I would request that any further discussion you may wish to carry on be done on the appropriate talk page. I do not welcone you on my own talk page. Denni 04:39, 2004 Apr 9 (UTC)

(Baas)This is not your territory.  This is the terrority of all who have a voice.

You contradicted yourself when you said that your prejudice was not with me but with the page, and then went on to explain how your prejudice was with me.

Then you insulted me.  Insults are not conducive to meaningfull discussion, nor do I in any way appreciate them.

Your failure to see connections is no evidence of intellectual omniscence.  This would be, in fact, an oxymoron.  Your arguments are overly presumptuous. Consequently, I feel no need to rebuttle. 

Furthermore, your attitude is unrespectably hostile.  09:31, 9 Apr 2004 (UTC)

Throckmorton and Hilfiger, though, in a paper published by me in 1997, say that """"idea"""" and """"self"""" are related through fractional intellidynamical impulses which emanate first from the self to the idea, and then back to the self, thus creating a a semantological unificationality of dogmatic theses.

2) Danzig is nt just German name. It's also name by which still the city is known in English world, although the fact probably will change in the future. Therefore it's reasonable to mention both names

M, This colon convention gets out of hand after maybe two. 
I've just looked over the articles you suggested I might take an eye to. We will have something to discuss, I see. You don't take on small issues! Much more daring than I am. 
I can have more to say later, of course, but first impression sis that there may very well be POV objections to most of these on grounds of opinion. Now that's inevitable in any sort of political or historical analysis and the best anyone can probably do is scratch a little rhetorical dirt over the most blatant. It's the basis for academic debate in these disciplines. Politics, though, is important, not just scholasticim redux and so it's worth doing. Enough blather. 

I see a major problem in that your perspective is too temporally narrow, POV allegations aside. I trace the Big Break (realignment or whatever) in American politics to the Bull Moose. Until then, both the Republicans and Democrats were broad parties with support from all classes, regions, etc (well, the Solid South was an exception for the obvious racist reasons, but...). When Teddy took the Progressives out in 1912, he made Wilson's election nearly certain and more importantly in the longer run, many (most) of those folks never went back. Think of La Follette or George Norris or Hiram Johnson, progressives (small p) all, and all (I think) Republicans. They wouldn't have been important or comfortable in the GOP of Harding, Coolidge, Hoover, Taft (pere ou fils) and their intellectual descendents weren't. It was the Repuplicans who staged a generations long witch hunt for Commies and unAmericanism. Even thouhg it was an idiot Democrat who started HUAC (Martin Dies  and he had a Soviet spy (!) as a fellow member  Dickstein I think it was). but the GOP found the structure conveninet to use. 
Think Nixon from his first election, or the GOP tolerance for McCarthy, Tom Delay, Newt Gingrich, Bomber Bob Dornan from California, etc. The 'Rockefeller wing' (misnamed) of the GOP was the last remnant of the people Teddy had taken out. Goldwater just made the ideological contraction more evident/blatant/inescapable. he wasn't actually very much in tune with the modern conservatives now dominating the GOP. Too independent of a specific agenda. 

This leaves the Dems as the only broadly based party, but remember that old saw about belonging to no organized party, I'm a Democrat. That's a distortion of the historic American pattern of two substandtial widely based parties, plus some minors. Maybe that pattern is changing, or not, but it's abberrant.

Enough. Have to go anyway. Tell me whether anything I've said is of any use.  23:41"

66.185.85.80's rant

Presently, we are witnessing  an open war against Croatian Dinaric culture.  Croatian Left often portrays this culture as """"primitive"""" and """"rural"""" (even """"fashist"""") being  in  service of Conservative HDZ party. Croatian writer Predrag Raos, for instance, """"performed"""" on gusle instrument in Zagreb on several occasions this year (2004) with only one intention - to ridicule the same instrument and its rich poetic tradition.
 
Another """"apostle"""" of Croatian Left - Miljenko Jergović - refers to his political opponents on the Right as """"gusle players"""". 

Some even claim the Serbian origin of Croatian Dinaric culture following the line of traditional greater Serbian propagabda (all štokavian people and their culture are Serbian). However, Croatian Dinaric folklore and its rich gusle heritage is primarly Croatian. Dalmatian costal region has been historically associated with this culture. For example, the first written document about the most popular folk hero of traditional gusle music, Marko Kraljević, is associated with Dalmatian island Hvar through Petar Hektorović's book """"Ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje"""", 1568). Also, the first historical document which mentioned gusle player and its instrument originated in  Dubrovnik (1547). Even now, a contemporary Croatian writer (born in Dubrovnik) Stijepo Mijović Kočan tells us a story about his uncle (also from Dubrovnik area) who could memorize numerous gusle songs (Stijepo Mijović Kočan: Gusle, Glasnik, May 25, 1992, p. 42). Dubrovnik is also a home of Anica Begin (born Kalafatović, 1816), a daughter of famous gusle player Ante. Although illiterate, she was able to recite by heart an immense number of gusle songs, some of which were recorded in antology of Croatian folk poetry. 
 
Not far from Dubrovnik, another coastal city - Makarska – was  also a bastion of Croatian gusle music. Actually, this region could be considered the Capital of all Croatian gusle players. This Mediterranean area  also gave birth to  Andrija Kačić Miošić (18th century Catholic priest), who is  viewed as the father of all gusle players of Croatia and beyond. To honour Kačić's work, Ivan Meštrović, the most famous Croatian sculptor, built a sculpture in America showing Kačić in his priestly clothes  playing gusle instrument.  

In addition to Kačić, Makarska Littoral produced a great many other followers of Croatian gusle music. According to dr. fra Karlo Jurišić (who quotes the work of Croatian folklorist Stipan Banović), Zaostrog alone  produced a great number of gusle players starting with Stipan Kosović-Kudrić (1771-1818) and culminating with the most known Mate Banović – Trliš (1844-1915).  As for Dalmatian women, they didn't play gusle (it's    considered   a male activity only), yet they were actively involved in spreading  gusle music  by  imitating its sound. 

Olinko Delorko, the researcher of  Dalmatian  folk poetry in the 1960s, states in his book Ljuba Ivanova (1969) that most of his Dalmatian folk poetry collection was obtained by  women, especially the ones from the island of Hvar. 

The Zadar Littoral also witnessed strong gusle tradition. English writer Maude M. Holbach, travelling through Zadar region in the first decade of 20th century  states in her book  """"Dalmatia: The Land Where East Meets West"""" that the gusle was the national instrument of the region. As for Dinaric dances, which took place at markets and certain festivals, they  are very picturesque and interesting, and worth going a long way to see, being a survival of ancient custom probably unique in Europe (p.54)

This admiration for Dinaric folk music, particularly gusle, was seen in both Dalmatian Litteral and  Hinterland.  Matija Murko, the researcher of this literary/music forms,  had reported   that during his trips  through Dalmatia in the 1930s, he saw a child, barely three years old playing gusle (Eduard Osredečki: “Hrvatske narodne junačke pjesme”, Željezno-Beč, p. 9)

Now, lets  take a look at  the names of some Dalmatian sports clubs and organizations: Hajduk, Junak, Gusar, Alkar, Uskok, sinjska alka, etc. What do they have in common? Of course, their names refer to the heroic gusle tradition of the region. 

Having this in mind, one wonders why this proud Croatian heritage has become almost  extinct.  Why do we have so few gusle players today ? Is it a  result of  unavoidable urbanization  of  modern Croatian society where peasant culture is being considered  inferior to global  rock 'n' roll  culture ? If so, why has tamburitza music of Northern Croatia  gained wide acceptance from the Croatian establishment while its  Dinaric counterpart (gusle music) is looked upon with suspicion and  open hatre"

That's a very a-historical point of view. The church was coming out with doctrinal statements about the trinity, and the Arians were twisting them and believing them. So the church went back and clarified what they meant. That's why some of the creeds are quite amazingly pedantic.

It's also a non-sensical point of view. You can't believe a bunch of words devoid of underlying meaning. You either believe them as they were meant, you mis-interpret them and thus mis-believe them, or you pretend to believe them. But there is no such thing as believing them without having a modicum of understanding. Sure you can believe some words are """"from God"""" but not know what they mean, but then you don't believe the doctrine you believe that there are some words that are true.

Apparently you didn't read what Augustine wrote. Let me refresh your memory...
""""Your today yields not with tomorrow, for neither does it follow yesterday. Your today is eternity; therefore You begat the Co-eternal, to whom You said, 'This day have I begotten Thee.' Thou hast made all time; and before all times You are, nor in any time was there not time.""""

Augustine directly links God being external to time with the begetting of the Son. Now if you have a  different point of view, prove it! Otherwise it is just hand-waving and show.

The doctrine of the church is important, but what it means is irrelevant? Come on!! Why look up Wik if not to find out what something means? You don't need Wik to read the Athanasian creed. You need Wik to *understand* it in its historical context.

> To answer your first question, the Church defines which beliefs are dogma

Then point me to where I can buy a book or books which is the final word on Christian dogma. Then I can verify for myself what parts of this article are dogma and which are opinion. Don't say the bible because it doesn't mention eternal generation.

Ah huh! But for Catholics it is DOGMA. Thus what is and isn't dogma the OPINION of different churches and persons.

At the end of the day folks, I have taken a quote from a church father that directly addresses the issue of """"eternally begotten"""" to explain to the reader the meaning. To take it down you would have to show either

a) Augustine was out of step with the rest of the church at this point.
b) The church was so confused, there are too many theories to discuss.

But to just say """"let it be a mystery! Don't tell them what it means!"""", sorry that doesn't wash.

(Ivo Banac)...A bit of nonteleological history
One of the great problems is that our understanding of the common and individual histories of the South Slavs and the other peoples of southeastern Europe has not significantly benefited from critical historiography. This is because nationalist historiographies regularly have explained modern developments as an aspect of unilinear design. We have been taught to see connections that may be of our own making. For example, if we look at a current political map of the area and compare it to that from the era of settlements we will see that the present political divisions do not correspond to those from the early medieval period. Croatia is mainly a coastal area from the Rasa River in Istria to the Cetina River, a little bit to the east of the city of Split. Down the coast from the original Croatia, we have a row of unfamiliar Slavic territories that Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus, the tenth-century Byzantine emperor-historian, called Pagania (literally, land of the pagans), Zachlumia (most of present-day eastern Herzegovina, with the Croatian peninsula of Peljesac), Terbounia (the Trebinje area of eastern Herzegovina, with Dubrovnik and its eastern coastal environs), and Dioclea (the southern portions of contemporary Montenegro with the Bay of Kotor and the northwesternmost portions of present-day Albania around Lake Skadar/Shkoder). Serbia is located in the hinterland of Zachlumia, Terbounia, and Dioclea, its center around Ras, near today's Novi Pazar, in the Sandzak. Bosnia was apparently within this territory, but represented a negligible area around the source of the Bosna River, where we now find Sarajevo and its environs. And Dalmatia? In the tenth-century this was a necklace of Byzantine-ruled Roman coastal cities and island territories, from Krk in the north to Ulcinj in the south.

Moreover, modern territoriality required a tradition that was itself a product of modernity. Thus, unrelated traditions were merged to produce an idea of ethnic-as opposed to cultural-continuity. The Croat historical tradition goes back to the Chronicle of the Priest of Dioclea (a twelfth-century text from Bar in contemporary Montenegro) and its various translations (for example, Marko Marulic, 1510), which were in turn incorporated into the Early Modern """"Slavic"""" and """"Dalmatian"""" histories of Mavro Orbin (1601) and Ivan Lucic (Ioannes Lucius, 1666). These works then became material for the Croatianizing work of Pavao Ritter Vitezovic (Croatia rediviva, 1700), who was the most important influence on the revivalist generation of Ljudevit Gaj (1809-1872) and that of postrevival integral nationalists like Ante Starcevic (1823-1896). Curiously, the same histories (Orbin's) were Serbianized through the translations of Sava Vladislavic (1722), which then influenced the pioneering Serbian histories of Jovan Rajic (1794), and were Bulgarianized in the history of Paisij Hilandarski (1762). The Bosnian historical tradition was somewhat more self-contained. It combined the Franciscan memory of medieval Bosnian statehood with the experiences of Muslim ayan (notable) selfrule to argue for a uninational Bosnia (for example, Antun Knezevic, whose book was published between 1884 and 1887).

Clearly, something has happened in the span of ten centuries. Pagania, Zachlumia, and Terbounia have disappeared. The center of Croatia has migrated from the Adriatic to the north, into medieval Slavonia (literally, Slavic land), with Zagreb at its head. This happened in stages. During the High Middle Ages, the heart of Croatia was on the Una River, now in northwestern Bosnia. This territory (Turkish Croatia) was lost to the Ottomans in the sixteenth century and became a part of Bosnia. During the Habsburg reconquest and the concomitant Venetian operations in the seventeenth century, the framework of modern Croatia emerged in two extended shanks-one, to the north, to modern Slavonia; the other, in the south, in modern Dalmatia. At the same time, the Zagreb area, which was only dubiously Croatian in the early Middle Ages, became the heart of modern Croatia.

The story of Serbia is not much different. Serbia first migrated to the coast and assimilated Dioclea. Then it moved to the Ibar-Morava valleys; then toward the valleys of Struma and Vardar in Macedonia. It reached the Danube only as an Ottoman vassal in the fifteenth century. And its modern capital, Belgrade, became truly Serbian only in the course of Karadjordje's uprising in 1806. Bosnia, too, expanded under Ban (or prorex) Kulin (r. 1180-1204) into the Donji Kraji (literally, Lower Lands) around the Vrbas River and the Soli (literally, Salt Lands; for centuries, Ottoman, then modern Tuzla) and Usora, in its present northeastern corner. Later on, at the height of its power in fourteenth century, Bosnia expanded into Hum (Herzegovina) and the Drina River valley. The westernmost regions were inc"

In the references there (look also that one in Lecture Notes in Mathematics) you find a decomposition of the space of all curvature structures in terms of Lie and Jordan algebras. And you find how elegantly electrodynamics and gravitational waves fit into the curvature play, look at the basic work of Lichnerowics. As an ,algebraiker' I like to write the curvature structure in the following triple form, generalizing the concept of Lie triples (the book of Otmar Loos is a nice generalization of Lie theory):
[x,y,z]=R(x,y)z. This concept generalizes the notion of a Lie triple to that one of a curvature triple, where only the Jacobiidentity is missing, but a reference to the bilinear form <,> is added in such a way, that R(x,y) is an element of the pseudoorthogonal Lie algebra. Note that the complete work of Ricci, Einstein and Weyl can be summarized as a decomposition of the space of curvature structures of Levi type (for Lie algebras). All this shows, that we do not yet understand this curvature space completely. Especially the gravitational wave aspect needs clarification. Hannes Tilgner"

 It would be useful if you dated your comments, it's much easier to follow the dates that way, rather than checking the history. I agree with Rjstott for the purpose of Wikipedia. AN, whoever you are, you are surely a person whith a scientific background. You certainly don't need this article in Wikipedia to explain the centripetal force. I wrote the following paragraph in the article:

It is important to understand right from the start that there is no 'default', 'natural' centripetal force. By default, objects tend to move in a straight line, as Newtonian mechanics teaches, away from the 'orbit', so in this context, by default there is only a centrifugal force at work. The centripetal force is being applied either by accident (meteors orbiting a planet) or artificially (satellites orbiting Earth, the object at the end of a rope etc). Therefore, the centrifugal force is a natural component of a circular movement, while the centripetal force is what we conventionally call the force keeping the object 'in orbit'.

 That paragraph has since been removed in favor of a more scientific approach. While I can agree that the statements in my explanation might have been misleading or imprecise from a scientific perspective (which is why I didn't revert the subsequent changes), I think they are a lot easier to understand by the person who needs to be explained how the centripetal/centrifugal forces work intuitively. Again, I will not fight for that paragraph, but I would like to see something easier to understand for the casual reader in the introduction.

 Let me explain what I mean with my """"intuitiveness"""" concern by using the following example: When a kid spins a rock at the end of rope he intuitively feels the centrifugal force. You will say that's not correct, he is applying the centripetal force, that's what he feels. But by that standard it would be difficult to explain gravity  following the same rationale, when you lift a suitcase you apply """"antigravity"""" to it. However, the kid will intuitively feel that he's """"beating"""" some force; when you explain that the downward force is called gravity and it's real, he's ready to accept that, although he's applying an upward force himself. People intuitively feel the force they need to """"beat"""" as the real force; the force they apply feels like the artificial part of the equation: the upward force to beat gravity is artificial, the gravity keeping the suitcase on the ground is natural. If you explain things the other way around, you confuse the casual reader. The same applies at an intuitive level with centripetal/centrifugal forces IMHO: if you start the article with an introductory statement which says that the centrifugal force doesn't really exist, that confuses the reader (""""then what's the force that I'm beating by holding on to the rope? Maybe I didn't get it right..."""") and s/he's most probably going to miss the point of the whole thing long before you get to formulas.  """

Although I have aired my frustration with 172 several times there, the issues have also been much discussed by me and others (i.e., """"only"""" yeah right).  As Cadr said on this very page ,  """"Agree with VV. A lot of constructive work was being done on the page; the problems are almost enitrely down to the user he mentions.""""

To summarize, it is 172 who refuses to budge and alter one word of the intro he wrote.  All other parties have written several draft intros each to try to accommodate objections and concerns.  172 dismisses these efforts as """"partisan bickering"""" and """"bullshit"""". - V

""""All other parties,"""" according to Veriverily, are the users (Cadr, EdPoor, AstroNomer, and himself) voting in the minority in the most recent round of polling. His preferred version does not have a """"consensus"""" behind it. This was really the winning position in the poll: """"Yes, it should be asserted, in both the intro paragraph and the CIA role in coup section, and not marked as controversial.""""  
Consensus had been reached before 172 started trolling; the poll was started afterwards and brought in random buddies of 172.  The poll voters he cites consist mostly of users who had no role in editing or contributing to the page and visibly no understanding of the issues and were voting ideologically.  Even so, the margin was only 8-5, far from overpowering.  Furthermore, one does not vote on whether to be neutral. - V

Potential and kinetic are a very general classification of energy forms. As stated in the present version of the article, these are mostly useful in mechanics. Based on the fact that a photon has no mass, the equations that are given in the present definition of kinetic energy are not applicable to electromagnetic radiation. I must say I agree with Andries. Also, this article is part of an encyclopedia. Why should it be limited  to the basic definitions of kinetic and potential energy forms and I see no reason why we are trying to associate energy forms as to being only potential or kinetic. I like the work done by Bensaccount, but I think it needs to be elaborated. Electrical energy, for example, has both forms of potential and kinetic energies. According to """"Principles of science"""", 1966, the most common forms of energy are mechanical energy, chemical energy, heat energy, sound energy (compressional waves), light energy (electromagnetic radiation), electrical energy and nuclear energy.

And I have talked to Catholics who were treated rather badly by church officals - especially in the times before the Second Vatican Council.

 Pro-Gay Bias? 
To be honest, I am not sure I entirely follow. What is exactly is meant by holding a """"pro-gay bias""""? That I am in favour of homosexuality? This seems entirely nonsensical, and indeed strictly speaking to be """"pro-gay"""" would mean you hold that it is a superior sexual orientation that all should aspire to. To be quite honest, I think the whole notion of a """"pro-gay bias"""" is entirely homophobic, and used to paint those who accept different sexual orientations in a manner that suggests they desire to promote homosexuality. Clearly, the article has a distinctly homophobic bias. It portrays a homosexuality as abnormal and deviant, homosexuality as a """"post-industrial"""" cosmopolitan lifestyle, and homosexuality as the social norm. These are all strongly homophobic POVs which are rejected by those who accept different sexual orientations (i.e., the majority of society in the West, and specifically progressives and social liberals). Those who hold such beliefs are indeed social conservatives who defend traditional morality and particularly heterosexual relationships. Stating the views of social-conservatives as objective facts, without even engaging with the beliefs of the majority of society who accept homosexuality, is clearly and irrefutably extremely biased. As is the implication that homosexuality has supposedly """"increased""""  as a result of the  """"modern urbanity of the post-industrial age"""", when in fact it is irrefutably due to the increasing acceptance of people's sexualities that has occurred in Western society in the 20th Century.

As for the debate about having an article for each episode, I have looked for episode summaries for Friends before and they are not very in depth.  What I was hoping to achieve in the wiki medium was to create relationships between plots and characters that may not be obvious in a regular 'summary' format.

However, issues between users, such as Wik, Theresa, 172, VV etc... are typically issues that should go through mediation before going through arbitration.

It seems people are totally forgetting the procedure of dispute resolution as suggested some time ago. Arbitration is about punishment, mediation is a soft way to achieve dispute resolution between participants. It is a gentler way to resolve a conflict. And it is also meant to be more gentle on others participants as it is a private solution, which do not force users to see an ugly display of accusations, threats, insults and generally speaking attacks between users, as we can see these days here and on the mailing lists. 

I have a problem with this. The MC basically finds itself plagued by trolls, and good participants just plainly refuse mediation. So, how useful is the mediation committee ? 

I'd like to mention something. In real life, people are more willing to accept mediation because there is a cost to arbitration that does not exist with mediation. This cost is in particular that
 arbitration is a long process
 arbitration is costly
 arbitration is sometimes unfair

I wonder if any arbitration on Wikipedia should not have a *cost* to all those involved. Apart from very specific cases of troll handling, most conflicts between regular participants are *not* due to only one party. If arbitration was more costly, perhaps participants would be more willing to discuss first, before heading to punishement. Perhaps should they be a cost, whatever the outcome ? Perhaps should the decision taken by the AC more costly in case there was refusal to discuss ? 

I believe that the concept of formal mediation here at Wikipedia has been a failure thus far.  This isn't entirely the mediators' fault, but rather a process and structure problem.  Contributing factors include:
 Mediation is being considered too late in the conflict cycle.  Once positions have been staked out, publicly and in permanent media, mediation is much more difficult.
 To be effective, mediators must have unimpeachable respect.  Real-world mediators are retired judges, former statesmen, former heads of corporations.  They are effective in part because they are perceived to have discretion, and balance.  The parties they serve believe they will act predictably and fairly.  The committee at present includes some members not known for this.  Moreover, Wikipedians as a rule do not extend """"unimpeachable respect"""" to much of anyone (due to the nature of the culture here).
 Mediation requests are presently public.  They should not be (c.f. MeatBall:GetARoom), since it leads to playing to the court.
 Process is """"not yet fully decided"""" (Wikipedia:Mediation Committee), which discourages people who could, potentially, be helped; indeed, the mediation-releated pages have an unfinished, essay-like feel to them overall.
 Some private discussion amongst the mediators themselves might help in this regard (GetARoom again), since it is more difficult to reach consensus in a MeatBall:fishbowl.  The WP community should get over its """"all discussions public and archived forever"""" fetish, which is disfunctional.  Consider the success of the IRC channel (which is more private than the wiki or the ML).
 There are inappropriately informal expectations of the mediators themselves (""""Mediators are independant in their choice of whose case to mediate, and how to mediate.""""  Wikipedia:Mediation Committee) while there are rigid and overbroad rules for those who they serve (""""You will then have to agree both on a mediator,"""" """"The mediator will check your motivation as regards mediation,""""
 It may be necessary to send some people to mediation.  I can think of several cases where contributors could, appropriately, be asked by the community to discontinue their edits to an article or group of articles until mediation is complete.  Lots of real-world success with this.
 We have a problem with some articles where carefully-crafted compromises are undone by editors who weren't involved in the original compromise, which prevents healing.  I know of no good way around this, but obseve that it is a barrier to successful mediation.

 IPA - what 

I read the main page of the article on IPA.
On the plus side it is clear.
On the minus side, it makes no attempt to explain what the IPA is.  (context, scope, purpose, etc.)
Nice chart.  Lots of data (for people who probably have no need of it) but virtually no general information.
My questions (which weren't answered - keep in mind I'm a totally lay person):
An alphabet is used to 1.  Communicate between a writer and a reader (of the same language), 2.  Describe that communication (unambigously?)  Right?

Certain things are implied by its name, but clearly one should define what the subject of the alphabet is (are).  I have no idea if it covers all indoeuropean languages not to mention Mandarin Chinese (etc.)?
Does it (attempt) to cover all spoken languages? Written?  What about non-vocal languages (finger snaps - all that stuff).  Sign-language?  We now have some evidence that hand gestures are linked to language in the brain...but I digress.  From a simplistic point of view language can be thought of as being three distinct (context sensitive) types of communication: written/read, spoken/heard and performed/viewed.  I suppose an alphabet can't cover the last (but see how choreographers describe dance) and, obviously, there are non-alphabetical languages (pictographics, heiroglyphic, etc.) just as there are languages which make use of whistles, clicks.  SO what does the IPA do?

It just occured to me that maybe the IPA is (now-a-days) only used by euro-centric hobbyists and that would explain why there was no attention given to giving a serious explanation of what it is: """"if you have to ask...{then you don't need to know}"""""""

Charles, thanks for tidying up the page I created on Pierre Fatou and looking up his born/died dates. In a later edit you added a comment about Mandelbrot sets being the popular name for Julia Sets. They are actually quite different; I updated the article with a more detailed description of the relationship between the work Fatou did, Julia's work and how this relates to the later work by Mandelbrot. The Mandelbrot set actually classifies the Julia sets - points in the Mandelbrot set have a connected Julia set and points not in the Mandelbrot set don't. The extra research was quite interesting as Julia and Fatou were coming up with their ideas at the same time and their theories were so similar, they are now referred to as the 'Fatou-Julia Theorem'.

The Ezekiel passage is quoted in the Moloch article in the 1899 Encyclopædidia Biblica as the strongest evidence for the theory that the offerings were considered to be to Yahweh (along with Jeremiah 7.31). Both passages are also cited in the Moloch aritlce in the 1908 Catholic Encyclopedia which reponds rather weakly (in my opinion): """"But this position is to say the least improbable. The texts appealed to may well be understood otherwise, and the prophets expressly treat the cult of Moloch as foreign and as an apostasy from the worship of the true God."""" It is cited in  1911 Encyclopædia Britannica: Moloch] with the comment: """"Note, also, the attitude of Ezekiel in xx. 25 seq., 31, references which cannot be explained away."""" The article The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: Molech; Moloch] treats it rather strangely, remarking:That this prophet regarded the practice as among the """"statutes that were not good, and ordinances wherein they should not live"""" (Ezekiel 20:25) given by God to His people, by way of deception and judicial punishment, as some hold, is highly improbable and inconsistent with the whole prophetic attitude toward it.
It is not clear what this means, quoting parts of the passage and paraphasing part of it and then adding """"as some hold"""". This article shows itself elsewhere quite aware of the theory that infants were sacrificed to Yahweh. It also brings in bogus Moloch-worship in connection to Carthage. Not a good article in any case.

Three different Rabbinical interpretations of the Ezekiel passage appear at . The interpretation by Rashi accords with the most obvious meaning, disliked by TRS, but the writer finds this inconvincing as not in accord with his own theology and prefers another interpretation. That would not be a reason to suppress Rashi's interpretation and the writer does not do so.

There is a discussion at  which covers in part John Day's treatment favorably but also discusses the Ezekiel passage in respect to the problem of the people's belief (and apparently Ezekiel's beliefs) that commands which Ezekiel saw as bad came from Yahweh. Note, John Day believes Moloch is not Yahweh, but that still does not answer the problems with that passage.

In short, the passage has been long used in support of the theory that the offerings of children lmlk was understood as commanded by Yahweh. It has long been in general a problem pasage. But those who feel that it is being misinterpreted do not suppress it. It is dishonest to present a theory that has been held and still is held and suppress its strongest supporting argument. On could respond by citing the Catholic Encyclopedia response (which seems to me weak). But add it with a citation if you will. But do not suppress.

The inclusion is not editorializing by me. I am presenting various theories that are held along with evidence for and against. The Ezekiel passage is cited as part of a common argument that children were sacrificed to Yahweh and normally used as support for that argument, indeed one of the main sources for that argument. My own POV, as much as I have one, is that the evidence is confused, there are good arguments as well as weaknesses in various positions, and that one should present all sides ... though of course full discussion would be a book length article. 

Your particular POV on a Biblical passages is not grounds to suppress it when cited with a different interpretation, especially when it is normally cited in the Moloch context by sources usually considered reputable, sometimes very much supporting the POV that the sacrifices were to Yahweh. Even when when that interpretation is rejected the Ezekiel passage is still cited in discussion.

I don't believe that anything I have included in this article, including the Ezekiel passage, is non-standard for discussion of Moloch. I have tried to present the vanilla arguments and give enough information to allow them to be understood. One obviously cannot agree with all sides. Moloch cannot easily be at once Yahweh, an entirely different god, the name of a kind of sacrifice. Passing through fire cannot be at the same time a human sacrifice or an initiation ceremony. But people do hold different views and the task of the article is to explain these views and give their history.

It should be obvious now that your original feeling that this material was novel was incorrect. Please let the normal statements used as arguments stand, regardless of the positions.

In the original German was a sentence, """"Vor dem Dalang liegt auch kein Bananenstrunk, der die Puppen aufnimmt, sondern ein Plangkan (eine Art Tisch mit Löchern in der Tischplatte), auf dem die benötigten Puppen bereit gestellt werden.""""

I am changing this to simply , """"In front of the Dalang is a Plangkan (a type of table with holes punched in its surface), on which the necessary puppets sit ready for use. 

I think (but am not certain) that the that the untranslated part is more or less a joke: roughly, that there what is on the table is not a foo foo drink for the puppets. If anyone with better German than me thinks I'm wrong and there is something more substantial here, please restore the appropriate phrase. Thanks.

 

Another sentence with which I had trouble: Die Figuren dieser Schattenspiele waren Wayang Golek (normale Kopfgestalt durch einen da-mit verbundenen Stab auf dem Rumpf drehbar. Arme durch je ein Stab, der an der Hand befestigt ist beweglich) , geschnitzte, bemalte und bekleidete Figuren, die an Fäden gezogen wurden, Malereien auf Schautafeln oder geweihte und verkleidete Menschen.

I've rendered this """"The figures in these puppet plays were wayang golek (normally a head assembly connected by a straight stick to a trunk, allowing the head to swivel. Arms were attached to a separate staff, allowing hand motions), carved, painted and dressed figures, manipulated via threads or strings, painted dioramas or sanctified and dressed humans,"""" but that may not be quite right. If you know better, please correct the article (and make a note here that you've done so).   18:03, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)

Your translation seems OK. Geweihte could also mean """"horned"""", which would make sense in the case of demons. """"Sanctified"""", as in """"blessed"""", makes less sense in the context.  12:44, 5 Jun 2004 (UTC)

Another tricky one: Wayang-Klitik-Figuren meist erheblich beschädigt, sehr zum Gaudium der Zuschauer..."""" I haven't even ventured a translation for this, it has several words I don't properly know. Is Gaudium perhaps the Latin word, as in """"gaudeamus igitur""""?   18:03, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)  This has now been satisfactorily rendered.   05:40, Jun 5, 2004 (UTC)

Another problematic sentence: Aus diesem Grunde haben Wayang-Klitik-Figuren, die zu Spielen herangezogen werden und dort Kampfszenen zu durchstehen haben, Arme aus Leder. I currently have this partially translated as """"On this basis the wayang klitik figures have, die zu Spielen herangezogen werden and where battle scenes zu durchstehen haben, leather arms."""" I know that durchstehen is to stand one's ground, but I still can't fully translate the sentence.   18:17, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)  This has now been satisfactorily rendered.   05:40, Jun 5, 2004 (UTC)

And another: Aus Jenggala und Kediri stammen die Geschichten von Raden Panji und Cindelaras, die ein paar Dorfjungen mit ihren Kampfhähnen erleben. The first part is """"From Jenggala and Kediri come the stories of Raden Panji and Cindelara,"""" I'm not at all clear on the latter part. My dictionary says Kampfhähnen are literally fighting cocks, but can just be pugnacious people.   19:46, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)
 Someone else has now simply rendered this as fighting cocks, but I'd consider that suspect (since one can't tell from the original German). I'd like to find a more primary source before considering this necessarily correct.   05:40, Jun 5, 2004 (UTC)
 I translated it as I did, because it explicitly says """"the boys with their X"""", and not somthing like """"the two x-like boys"""".  12:44, 5 Jun 2004 (UTC)

In particular, phrases like """"Kerry wants to grant rights to homosexuals"""" (which I removed altogether) I find to be somewhat sub-NPOV. The position of the GLBT community is not unlike that of women and minorities in previous eras: that they have rights that are not being recognized or equally protected. I suppose a truly neutral phrasing would acknowledge that some people feel that such rights do not exist and thus do not deserve broad legal protections or social recognition. I opted to just remove the most contentious phrase, which was redundant anyway, and to add qualifiers to another phrase to reflect the Jeffersonian POV w.r.t. inalienable rights.

For an encyclopedia based around the concept of a Neutral Point of View, any attempt to either counter or defend the content of a subject that is, in itself, an editorial statment seems wrong; such discussions wind up as parasites draining the life and meaning out of an otherwise useful article.

Radnath Sikdar
Dear Mr.Hike,

Thanks for your notice/warning/intimidation! Since, I could sense an emotional outburst in your message, I thought it would be worth spending a few seconds calming you down )

Please be careful in your edits
Oh sure...Iam always careful. I do not send baseless assumptions as warning shots to anyone ) 

Regarding Radhanath Sikdar: I think you need to realize that Wikipedia is a collaborative work - we develop articles by consensus. 
Thanks for your enlightenment. Unfortunately someone already taught me this fact a long time ago when I first ventured into this wikipedia ) Thanks anyway.

Simply reverting edits is counter-productive and against the etiquette of the Wikipedia.
I think this is your POV! There is a 'revert to previous page' button. May be your highness should dismantle it.

Commonly, we iterate until we can find language and fact statements that are acceptable to everyone. Notice that this iteration isn't a """"reversion war"""" - people discuss and change and adapt the article until consensus is reached.
Another POV again ) By the way - could you please enlighten me about who your 'we' refers to in all the above sentences?

Please explain why you are insisting on """"now called"""" in the Sikdar article, or, for that matter, why you are insisting on the mention of the name """"Sagarmatha"""". There may be a legitimate NPOV reason for the inclusion of both - without explanation, I am assuming that it is motivated by Hindu nationalism.

I must appreciate your exceptional ability to assume things. Fortunately, I am not a religious fanatic. But, I do know that provocative sentences like this fuel hatred and anger in the hearts of those groups you mentioned. Again I may be wrong. You know all ) But, I do feel that there is no 'present day sun' or 'present day moon'. That was the only impetus behind my editing it. Besides I also thought that there is nothing wrong in representing a fact (name 'sagarmatha'). Again you know all. 

My assumption very well may be incorrect, but no explanation of your reversion has been given. Convince me.
I confirm that your assumption is not only untrue but is provocative and preposterous. Sometimes even highly intelligent people like you do mistakes )

Note that the original name of Presidency College (in Calcutta, founded in 1817) was """"Hindoo College"""". Not """"Hindu"""" (as in the religion). Please stop reverting. It seems to me that if you insist on using one of the original names of Mount Everest, for consistency you must also use the original name of the college. Convince me otherwise.
As far as I could remember, I have been taught that the right spelling is Hindu, in India. Could you please let me know the difference between Hindoo and Hindu? By the way, could your highness ) please let me know how you assumed that I am an Hindu? I again appreciate your astrological prowess! Astrology is many a times fake - just fyi your highness )

I do not know why messages like this from people who know everything, makes me a little sad sometimes. I am envious of the brilliant people like you who can assume a boat load of stuff with just a two-line edit! 

We can continue this discussion at Talk:Radhanath Sikdar: that way, many people can participate.

It seems to give a status to that one recording which is not due (I speak as a trumpet player who very much admires Wynton as a player, but is very suspicious of the hype which sometimes attends him) and which seems to ignore the many fine recordings of this piece which have been made before and after that one. It's not a situation like Gorecki 3 or the loathsome The Piano. It just, from where I am sitting, entirely lacks the feeling of a crossover. It's just one good recording, among many, of a very popular piece.

2DVgXI+rCUoDINcxJt3ReHTueFw=,"""== Attributing and classifying of personalities == 
Invitation. Your input to Culture of Lithuania is welcomed. 
Some problems of defining personalities or attributing them to certain well-known ideological systems may raise here. I propose a quite liberal variant of it, where definition may not be connected with one certain word. Necessity however to follow certain classifying remains. 

My initial ideas on this branch, the ones, concerning period of Lithuanian national Renaissance period: Some artists, writers or other cultural workers of this period are often described as  modernists. This definition is not false, but some more concrete things should be added, some specifics of Lithuania. 
We should distinguish leading ideas of the Nat. Renaissance from later modernism, which is more known for us. Cultural aspirations of the later Nat. Ren. may be defined as  modernism in a cultural context of Lithuania. But they accented also expression of Lithuanian cultural heritage, and their expression may be seen as something simply typically  Lithuanian. I mean, that such authors in as  Čiurlionis is seen as modernist in Lithuanian context, but it also (and even more) is a representative of Lithuanian culture, when in European or World-wide context. A parallel  example may be taken from literature of India. Poet  Tagore, well known Nobel price winner is known for us as a representative of culture of India. Making India more understandable and closer for western people is concerned as main his input to Western culture. But in his own country, he was seen as a modernist too, who was changing traditional cultural forms, especially stagnated ones. This way also Lithuanian cultural leaders of the N. Ren. could be seen as modernists, which were broadening cultural forms and changing stagnated ones, in Lithuanian context. They also can be seen as modernists in a wider context, but more for acquainting Western people with Lithuanian culture than for their direct input into Western culture. Čiurlionis is the best example here. 
In other way, the later Lithuanian modernists (they depended mostly to later  generation, approximately from 4th decade of the 20th century) concerned themselves part of Western modernistic movement and their main purpose (looking generally) was  to introduce Western European ideas into Lithuanian cultural life (see the table below). 
We see two different movements and two different world outlooks here. The problem is, that both movements collaborated, especially their political wings did, and interchange of ideas between them is well seen. So, many researchers don't pay attention to this difference. Especially in the Soviet period, when national ideas were officially forbidden, mixture in description of these movements was allowed. E. g. philosopher Ramūnas Bytautas, who clearly depends to the first generation, is often described as liberal. And it may be understood in a sense of the second generation (as idea of liberalism).
 

 period and generation  artists, writers, philosophers etc in a context of Lithuania in an European context The National Renaissance period, the younger generation, approx 1905 – 1930  painter and composer  Čiurlionis, painter Kazys Šimonis, poet and philosopher Vilius Storastas - Vydūnas, dramatist Sofija Kymantaitė - Čiurlionienė, poets Adomas Jakštas, Motiejus Gustaitis, Liudas Gira, composer Stasys Šimkus, philosopher Ramūnas Bytautas.  reformers and innovators of Lithuanian culture Representatives of Lithuanian culture, almost unknown before them.

 New Reversion War 

Hi,
I don't know whether you've been keeping up with the Race article or not. Somebody put some unrepresentative pictures up and labeled them as members of various [races]. That addition was reverted by Peak, and several more reversions have occurred without any discussion other than in the edit summaries.

Fugitives categorized by the FBI into different """"races"""". From left to right: White, Black, Hispanic Mestizo, Asian. Top row males, bottom row females.Does asserting a racial identity give any more information than is contained in the photographs? See the discussion below.

 More discussion of changes 

Here's a few excerpts from the article that I'd like to visit:

1. """"Smith's earliest religious experiences, which involved heavenly visions and visitations, the use of seer stones to obtain obscure knowledge and to locate buried treasure, were not uncommon where Smith lived, and the fashionably elite Protestant clergy of the area were not impressed by Smith's early visions and divinations, but neither were they likely surprised or alarmed""""

There are a couple problems with the above.  First, whether seer stones were used by others to obtain obscure knowledge particularly """"where Smith lived.""""  (I'll explain why I think that's important later.)  Second, whether Joseph used """"the"""" seer stones (Urim and Thummim) to locate buried treasure, and whether such efforts were religious experiences (to him they were not).  (To my knowledge his treasure hunting efforts were limited to the time prior to obtaining the Urim and Thummim.)  Third, whether the """"fashionably elite Protestant clergy"""" (whatever that means, which probably needs changing) were not impressed by the early visions and divinations (and subsequently not surprised or alarmed).  This claim should either a) be removed for its lack of verifiability, or b) be augmented by the remarks that Joseph himself makes as a first-hand witness.

I honestly don't have a recommended alternative.  The entire paragraph is fairly ripe for discussion in my opinion.  Just to recap:

a. Whether the use of seer stones was restricted to Joseph's residential area.
b. Whether treasure hunting was a religious experience for him.
c. i. Whether the term """"fashionably elite"""" is remotely relevant to the article.
c. ii. Joseph's own recount of clergy response should be included at the very least.

2. """"the Burned-over district of western New York where Joseph Smith, Jr. was raised"""" is facially inaccurate.  Joseph spent the first ten years of his life in Vermont, with only four years in New York prior to the First Vision. I suggest the following rewording of the second half of the entire sentence:

""""that campaign also took place in the Burned-over district of western New York where Joseph Smith, Jr. had lived for four years.""""

3. """"Nevertheless, Mormon extrapolations regarding Jesus are in many ways more similar to the earliest Christian heresies.""""  A rather strong claim , and I don't mind keeping it in, but it should be on the following conditions:
1. """"earliest"""" be quantified to a given year, and """"Christian"""" quanitified to a sect of the time.
2. We add the following text from Hugh Nibley's """"The World and the Prophets,"""" which tells of a time when current generally-accepted Christian beliefs were heresies:
""""Ignatius of Antioch writes to the Trallians: 'There are some Christ-betrayers... They introduce God as being unknown.' And to the Smyrnaens he says: 'Do ye, therefore, mark those who preach other doctrines, how they affirm that the Father of Christ cannot be known."""" (page 55)
""""The great crime of the heretics in general, according to the Apostolic Constitutions, is 'that they blaspheme God by saying that he is unknowable and not the Father of Christ...but is indescribable, unutterable, unnamable, self-begotten...'"""" (page 55)

4. """"Mormon followers of Brigham Young generally believe in Young's doctrine that Jesus was """"born"""" into a """"spirit body"""", like the rest of humanity, and remained in that state until his Incarnation.""""

The word incarnation doesn't fit the context of the sentence, and I'd prefer to discuss Mormonism here.  I recommend we change that to say:

""""The branch of Mormonism lead by Brigham Young teaches that Jesus was """"born"""" into a """"spirit body,"""" like the rest of humanity, and remained in that state until his mortal birth.""""

5. """"He claimed to have received revelation only after asking questions about a subject, pondering, and praying to God for an answer. As Smith's teachings evolved, his later teachings painted a strikingly different picture of the Father and the Son with physical celestial bodies, being one in purpose together with the Holy Spirit.""""

I think the first sentence is out of place (read it in context to see my meaning).  I'd like to clarify the second sentence; it could be understood that Smith's teaching's regarding the Godhead changed rather than expanded.  I'd like to reword as follows:

""""As Smith's teachings about God expanded they gradually painted a strikingly different picture of the Father and the Son than that of other churches, with each possessing a physical, purified body, being one in purpose with the Holy Ghost.""""

ok,  this misses some of the key points and misstates it a bit. I appreciate your effort though.  Precise definition is difficult to paraphrase, isn't it?

""""other authorities agree that they will not overrule""""
their agreement is not necessary, only the legal right to not be overruled 

De facto sovereignty, the second, is actual power,  
'the actual exercise'  'actually using'...etc.    of that power.  But 'power' that's a word that can't be used in this sense without FURTHER definition,because it's too ambiguous outside of a context that specifically implies what meaning is meant.                                  

I think if we have the word 'exclusive' (the key point) in the opening paragraph, the rest can be saved for the later paragraph, where it is now... sparing people who just want the overview from reading mumbojumbo, but retaining the info for those who want a more thorough exposition.

If a sovereign state can make a decision but cannot carry it out, the recognized sovereignty of the state is essentially meaningless.

I think this is a splendid summation of the concept of defacto sovereignty  I think if we 
keep the defacto vs dejure info in the 'differing views' section, it ties together the 3 seemingly different views by the common thread of, """"no matter what your view is on sovereignty , you have to have it to use it and use it to have it""""

and if we add your summary it makes the 'differing views' section just about right. 

A key element of sovereignty in the legalistic sense is that of exclusivity of jurisdiction. 

Specifically, when a decision is made by a sovereign entity, it cannot generally be ovverruled by a higher authority.  Further, it is generally held that another legal element of sovereignty requires not only the legal right to exercise power, but the actual exercise of such power.  (""""no de jure sovereignty without de facto sovereignty"""") In other words, neither claiming/being proclaimed Sovereign, nor merely exercising the power of a Sovereign is sufficient, sovereignty requires both elements. 

If a sovereign state can make a decision but cannot carry it out, the recognized sovereignty of the state is essentially meaningless.

But if I may? I think this is one tiny bit better, as it applies to the anarchists, monarchs,etc:
If a sovereign - person or state - can make a decision but cannot carry it out, their recognized sovereignty is essentially meaningless.

In that form, I really like it.  How does that read to you? I think at this point the article is accurate, and pretty safe to expand on.  If the readability issue is good, (I'm blind to that, Ive read too much legalese to notice much if it sounds stilted or awkward), I'd say we are pretty set. Want to pick at it a bit and post your change?  I think it's a consensus at this point, pretty much."""

Nash equilibria
The game theory section is quite confused, which is amusing given how straightforward the analysis claims to be.

The article can't decide whether it's talking about a single-round Nash equilibrium, or the Nash equilibrium of a repeated game.  It talks about repetition, and a threatened """"retaliation"""" the Predictor, but it describes an equilibrium which doesn't need retaliation or a repeated game at all.  The equilibrium {choose both boxes, predict both boxes} is quite stable for the single-round game, and is the only Nash equilibrium.

Both players choosing """"one box"""" is also a Nash equilibrium for the repeated game.  However, when we have a repeated game, another Nash equilibrium is possible.  If the Predictor adopts a strategy """"always choose one box unless the Chooser chose two boxes last round"""" then the Chooser can also always choose one box and have no incentive to deviate.  Deviating would net an extra 1,000 for that round, but would cap the maximum payoff at 1,000 in the next round, where it would have been 1,000,000.  Hence, the deviation is discouraged and the equilibrium is stable.

The real question is, is any of this germane to the article's topic?  If this section could be made concise and simple, I could see including it.  I don't see a way to make it concise and still correct unless you want to dismiss the possibility of playing repeatedly.  02:41, 12 Aug 2004 (UTC)"""

kr+KqihemDuYhomegd3zQJ+8xiw=,"Well, although I do concede that most (if not all) of those Mexican States are named after the cities, I still think that the State should have priority since a) Politically and geographically is more important b) They will be linked way more often than the cities. To illustrate my point, let’s take the State of Oaxaca. We will need a link to the state in every single municipality (Oaxaca has 570!), in every single river that passes by, in every single lake, lagoon, dam, forest, desert, valley, plateau, mountain, cave, indigenous group, highway, bridge, volcano, beach, port, island... Even in biographies: governors, senators, people that fought battles there, colonized… 

Keep in mind that most of us do not advocate the application of the North American convention to Mexican cities (City, State), so whenever we want to be more specific, we make links like Xyz, Oaxaca not Xyz, Oaxaca (state). By giving priority to the States we could type less and have fewer links to fix in those articles made by visitors, newbies or people not familiar with the country (most wikipedians). If someone says that José Vasconcelos was born in Oaxaca but links to the state instead of the city, s/he is still OK, not as precise as s/he intended to be, but s/he’s still correct. But if someone says that the cave of Guilá Naquitz is in Oaxaca and points to the city instead of the State, s/he is plain wrong.

it in another way. The approach has been of another sort: a more rational
approach, considering the tendencies and natural things of the human being,
who simply must be respected. This is the philosophy with which I view these
problems. I think that there has to be consideration shown toward the family
that suffers these situations. I would hope that the families would have another

Why the Prophet Jeremiah should not be censored out of this article 

All the abusive invective in the world doesn't alter the fact that when we consider the Jewish law, the following is relevant:
  
'How can you say, """"We are wise and the law of the LORD is with us when, in fact, the false pen of the scribes has made it into a lie.'      
Jeremiah 8:8, New Revised Standard Version 

It is relevant because:

 Jeremiah is a major Jewish prophet, so his opinion carries weight.
 Jeremiah lived over 2000 years closer to the time when the books of Moses were compiled.

The fact that another contributor is so determined to remove this evidence from the public record demonstrates that the point Jeremiah makes is sensitive. Nevertheless it is also highly relevant to any rational discussion about this aspect of the Jewish law, and for that reason should remain.

If other contributors wish to argue that Jeremiah's comment about scribal ethics is not relevant to Biblical passages about circumcision, they are welcome to demonstrate this. However, censorship is not the way to make this point."""

 Controversy - a litltle balance, maybe? 

I'm fully aware that most of the authors of this articles are pro-Kerry or at least anti-Bush, but should it be quite so obvious to the reader?  

Actually, the main part of the article (while not always completely balanced)has a fair amount of give-and-take, attempting to lay out each side's statements and the other's responses.  It's clear that we have some very different opinions, but we're making some good headway here.

BUT the """"Controversy"""" section is almost entirely attacks from one side(about two dozen sentences), the long list of allegedly significant """"ties"""", and numerous (often angry) quotes from Kerry's team and supporters (including many in the media), many of which add little or no actual information or argument for their position.  On the other side we find a few brief Bush-Cheney denials, and maybe two quotes.  Fine, if you're trying to sound like an LA Times editorial.  But I didn't think that's what we were after here.

(And, of course, there is the insistence that certain responses to charges are not relevant, even if these are the actual responses Bush, et.al. are making.   I didn't think it was our job to judge the strength of each side's argument simply to seek to represent it fairly.)

Could we afford to shorten and limit the number of quotes that add more heat than light?   And is it possible to resist the temptation to insist that every statement that might appear more favorable to Bush or Cheney (there are precious few as it is!) must immediately be countered?"""

The net effect is that you deleted a bunch of content, plus which there is more to say about each individual rate (construction particulars for instance), plus it doesn't work with the categorization system. When thinking about merging articles, one important thing to consider is whether the article is small because it's new and needs more content, or it will always be small. In the case of the RN rates, all have much to say about them - rationale, evolution, employment, plus a picture or two so we can see what they looked like. This article should be about the system as a whole (who introduced it and why? When did it go out of use?

9AMFrAGRdlLbksfYid56cYoATcs=,"""Fish-man, hello, and welcome to Wikipedia.  Thank you for taking the time to examine Wikipedia policies and base your arguments for keeping No-boo on them, and also for being polite when making your arguments.  VfD pages really aren't the place for me to be making lengthy arguments, so I'll respond to your points here instead.

First, you should be aware that anonymous users who sign up for accounts just to argue about the article being voted on are still effectively anonymous users, and are still not going to have their votes counted.  At this point I think it is really too late for you to establish a history at Wikipedia that would result in your vote being counted.  Again I refer you to Wikipedia:Deletion_guidelines_for_administrators#Rough_consensus for this information.  (Anonymous authors who request that their articles be deleted are often given consideration, but not those who want them kept.)
Whether they're specifically enumerated on What Wikipedia is not or not, articles about neologisms are not encyclopedia material.  Firstly, #2 on that page indicates that Wikipedia articles are not dictionary definitions, and as a neologism is just a particular kind of word, an article on a neologism is necessarily a dictionary definition.  Secondly, encyclopedia articles cannot describe neologisms because they cannot describe things that are as yet unestablished.  """"No-boo"""" may or may not be a word with some currency today, but it remains to be seen whether it will become part of the language.  Once we can determine that the term has staying power and is culturally or historically significant—which time will likely not come for months or years—then we can write an article on it.  Or rather, we could, if it weren't going to be just a dictionary definition.
If the article in question is not about a word but actually about an event called """"The No-boo Affair"""", then it ought to be entitled No-boo Affair.  In that case, I would still vote to delete it, on the grounds that it is a news story.  Again, there is no evidence at this time that this news story is going to have any historical significance, and considering that the substance of the news story is """"the AP made a mistake; they said some people booed at a speech but really nobody did"""", it seems very unlikely that it will ever have historical significance.  (You characterize the AP's error as a """"clear falsification"""", but I see no evidence of malicious intent by the AP, and anyway it's still not an encyclopedia's job to document falsehoods by the AP.  If the AP has a history or pattern of such falsehoods, and it is well-documented by other unbiased sources, then we can make a note of it in Associated Press.)  If the term """"no-boo"""" becomes well established—which, again, we will not know for months or years—then perhaps it will be appropriate for us to record this news story as the origin of the term.  Certainly, Wikipedia has articles on other recent news stories.  However, most are stories of definite historical signficance, and those that are not should also be deleted.
Wikipedia wants articles on items that are currently in the news, yes.  In this case there are many things related to the story that people might want to look up.  If we didn't already have them, we could add articles on George W. Bush, William J. Clinton, West Allis, Wisconsin, booing, the Associated Press, the White House, the Republican National Convention, New York, etc.  But this """"No-boo Affair"""" is not an encyclopedic topic in the news; it is a breaking news story.

It is important to understand that an encyclopedia is not simply a gathering of assorted facts, but rather a secondary source that compiles significant pieces of human knowledge that have already been well-established by other sources.  There are many places on the internet and offline where you can disseminate facts and opinions about this event, but Wikipedia is not one of them.  — 18:08, 15 Sep 2004 (UTC)"""

 Dante, I agree that it is the use of the word that constructs a POV.

I know, you want me to hold the burden of proof.  Anglo-Frisian and Old Norse have the most extreme maritime influences, including those Non IE Roots discussed on the Talk:Germanic languages page where you bureaucratically assaulted me also.  As formerly stated(before Diderot POV pushed the article with a massive edit) on the Non IE Roots page(), Celtic is another language group holding a considerable amount of Non IE Roots.  Apart from any Basque influences, Celtic seems to have Non IE terms concentrated mostly in the British Isles, where they were joined by the Anglo-Frisians and Norse.  It is blatantly clear to anybody that the Mediterranean influence on High German is astounding.  The older Nordic and Germanic writings appear less structured and thought out, but the more evolution into current speech, the tongues have been so standardised by latinisation, especially.  One cannot seriously refute that the Anglo-Frisian and West Norse tongues follow the least marked latinising structures on their tongues of the Germanic languages(and especially borrowing scientific terms), apart from writing them in latin script, with a few native letters especially in Icelandic to this day.  The Baltic East Norse tongues gained a considerable conversion by the influence of the Low German speakers of the Hanseatic League in their everyday life, most notable in the Hanseatic Cities, like Visby on Gotland.  Since High German has been standardising itself all throughout Germany, having a marked effect upon such others as Austrian and Swiss German, all the dialects of Germany and even in Eastern Europe are suffering at the officialisation and BBC type overtaking.  See the German language page for more information in this regard.

However, before 1945  the town was known to non-Poles as Allenstein, as a glance at any contemporary travel guide will attest. Witness also the League of Nations plebiscite in southern East Prussia, which as shorthand was referred to as """"the Allenstein district"""" (Cf. Churchill's memoirs).

I'd like to clarify my concerns with the current version of the article, following the reversion of some of my edits by Stirling Newberry.

My general concern is that it doesn't accurately describe the debate about various causes of hyperinflation.  The article seems to me to be describing a stereotyped view of each side of the debate, which exagerrates the amount of controversy and obscures the amount of common ground.  """"Monetary"""" and """"Crisis of confidence"""" explanations of hyperinflation are describes as if they are two completely different competing theories,  held by different schools of thought (""""monetarists"""" and """"neo-liberals"""").

I think that the overwhelming majority of economists would see both monetary and confidence factors as being important as the initial 'root cause' of hyperinflation, with the importance varying from case to case.  A lot of the economics is very uncontroversial. For example:
It's totally uncontroversial that a massive increase in the money supply will cause hyperinflation.  Virtually any economist will agree that a big increase in the money supply is a possible trigger for hyperinflation, even if they don't believe it's the only one.  To say imply that neo-liberal economists don't believe that some hyperinflations are initially triggered by monetary expansion is to caricature their position.
It's totally uncontroversial that loss of confidence in the monetary system has a big role in hyperinflation.  To imply that monetarists don't see a role for reestablishing confidence in the currency - that just 'stopping the printing presses' is enough - is just misleading.  Monetarists talk about ways of establishing confidence all the time.

I would be interested to hear from Stirling what specific inaccuracies were in my edits, and why he deleted the statement """"The two models are closely related, and often economists may explain hyperinflation as being due to a combination of both effects.""""

Hi Darius, a part of the reason I think the genocide looms so large, and deserves space in a 3 paragraph summary is because it is still a """"big deal"""" and current event topic.  There are laws being drafted in Turkey restricting freedom of speech on this issue even as they try to join the E.U.  Major motion pictures like Ararat which cover the genocide cannot be shown in Turkey, sometimes due to the government, sometimes due to terrorist threats.  So perhaps when there is an admission, and the topic fades out, the time will have come to relegate this solely to the history pages.

Meanwhile, no two genocides are alike, but the Armenian/Jewish ones have a great deal in common.  The scale of both surpassed a million, both ended in the murder of over half the population and expulsion of the rest, both were done under cover of world war, both had nationalistic and religious overtones, while targetting a minority known for industriousness and wealth, and the similiarities go on.  The """"neutrality"""" of information has only been an issue because unlike post-war Germany, which was thoroughly defeated, Turkey, which had signed a treaty of Sevres which stipulated an independent Armenia who's borders were drawn by President Wilson of the USA instead had an internal revolution, changing all their treaties so as not to even mention Armenia ONCE, and then began a massive government campaign to rewrite history.

Reader's Digest, Jack/Joe
Hey, a few years ago I was reading a really old Reader's Digest and I swear I actually read an article written first person from an organ's point of view.  (I don't remember which.)

...and the guy's name was Joe.

This was before I read the book, so I just thought it was a really odd coincidence at the time...I can't seem to find the article anymore, though.  Does anyone else have any info on this?  Was Joe changed to Jack to avoid legal troubles with the original """"Joe's XXXXXX"""" author?

 The author of the book was talking about real stories from Reader's Digest, so you probably did read the same ones he refered to. """"Joe"""" is changed to """"Jack"""" in the movie because Reader's Digest wasn't willing to allow them to mention it in the film.  LGagnon

I have a copy of John Pekkanen's article """"I am John's Brain Tumour"""", from Reader's Digest (South Africa) 1990-12, volume 137, number 824. Chapter 7 of my copy of Palahniuk's Fight club has """"I am Jane's Uterus. I am Joe's Prostate. [...] I am totally Joe's Gallbladder"""", ISBN 0-099-28333-6, Vintage (1997) UK Random House. The English RD sites I searched came up empty. The earliet """"Joe""""s I found were two 1974 videos  from """"Pyramid Films"""". I found that """"Pyramid Media"""" credits it to RD . Does anyone have a source of an actual Reader's Digest article with """"Joe""""? - , 2004-04-15t22:37z

 It is mentioned on the commentary for the DVD that Reader's Digest told them not to use """"Joe"""". Apperantely they own the copyright somehow. Either way, the narrator in the book does use Joe rather than Jack. And given that the book is the original story, I believe that """"Joe"""" should be used more often in the article than """"Jack"""" (though """"the narrator"""" fits the character's """"name"""" more accurately). The article seems to lean too much towards being about the movie, which makes it seem as if it was the original source material instead of the book. It would be best that we keep the article based mainly on the book, with details on the movie where applicable. Otherwise, what we would be doing would be the equivelent of someone making the Lord of the Rings article more about the Peter Jackson movie than JRR Tolkien's work.  LGagnon

Tyler section
We should merge the Tyler Durden section into the characters section. There isn't a need for 2 separate sections on him. As it is it looks redundant and a bit sloppy. Any details that don't fit that section can go into a different one.  LGagnon

I just recently updated the article on Chuck Palahniuk with info on how Fight Club came to be. This is in the first paragraph of the Biography section. I was wondering if anyone thought we should include that info in this article, since it gives the backstory of how it was written.   Talk]] 12:00, 27 Jul 2004 (UTC)

There seems to be inconsistency on how this name is rendered in English characters. I also found Shaista Khan in Shivaji .

3. Could someone confirm that Killedar means a garrison commander?

Or if it doesn't correct it.

4. I assume (from context) that Durga also means fort or maybe  a fortified town. 

Is that correct? But see current article Durga .

5. We're missing article for Sangram Durga, or maybe we're missing an article for Sangram and an expansion of  Durga

The '''Great Purge''' is the name given to the events of the late [[1930s]] in the [[Soviet Union]], when millions of people were arrested, about one million executed, and an estimated 12 million to sent to labour camps.  According to [[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences|Nikita Khrushchev]] a significant part of the accusations were based on forced [[confession]]s and on loose interpretations of vague articles of [[Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code)]], which dealt with counter-revolutionary crimes. Due legal deliberation was largely replaced with express trials by [[NKVD troika]]s.  The purge targeted all categories of the society: members of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]], the government, the armed forces and the intelligentsia, as well as """"anti-Soviet elements"""" among peasants ([[kulak]]s), in industry, and in transport. The height of the purge occurred while the Soviet secret police (the [[NKVD]]) was headed by [[Nikolai Yezhov]], from September [[1936]] to August [[1938]]; this period is often referred to as the '''Yezhovschina''' (""""Yezhov storm""""). However, the purge was carried out on the orders of Stalin himself.

Furthermore you seem to be unfamiliar with generally accepted knowledge with respect to this area.

Creationism is the explanation  that the universe and all life were created by the deliberate act of God.

In looking through the historical record at the competition between creation and evolution in Darwin's day, I was impressed by Thomas Huxley's 1887 account of how Origin of Species provided the first explanation that in Huxley's view was a better explanation than creation.  Huxley describes the sense in which he rejected creation as an explanation.

If Agassiz told me that the forms of life which had successively tenanted the globe were the incarnations of successive thoughts of the Deity; and that he had wiped out one set of these embodiments by an appalling geological catastrophe as soon as His ideas took a more advanced shape, I found myself not only unable to admit the accuracy of the deductions from the facts of paleontology, upon which this astounding hypothesis was founded, but I had to confess my want of any means of testing the correctness of his explanation of them. And besides that, I could by no means see what the explanation explained. 

Huxley describes his similar rejection of the explanations of the evolutionists prior to Darwin.

And, by way of being perfectly fair, I had exactly the same answer to give to the evolutionists of 1851-8. . . . [A] thorough-going evolutionist, was Mr. Herbert Spencer, whose acquaintance I made, I think, in 1852. . . . Many and prolonged were the battles we fought on this topic. But even my friend's rare dialectic skill and copiousness of illustration could not drive me from my agnostic position. I took my stand upon two grounds: firstly, that up to that time, the evidence in favor of transmutation was wholly insufficient; and, secondly, that no suggestion respecting the causes of the transmutation assumed, which had been made, was in any way adequate to explain the phenomena. Looking back at the state of knowledge at that time, I really do not see that any other conclusion was justifiable. 

Furthermore, any self-respecting religion-neutral anthropologist, such as Robert L. Carneiro, Curator of the American Museum of Natural History, would classify creation and evolution as mere successive stages of incomplete but improving explanations in a universe where there is no God to assist the women and men who attempt to discover the truth of their origins. 

From all of the above, I suggest that it is more accurate to define creationism as an explanation rather than a belief.  After all, the survival of the belief derives from the usefulness of the belief, and a primary use of creationism is explaining how we all got here.  According to Thomas Huxley, until Origin of Species, creationism was as good an explanation as evolutionism.  And for the majority of American voters who cannot understand the evolutionists' explanations, creationism is a better explanation than evolutionism even yet today.  - 16:08, 25 Aug 2004 (UTC)

 Considering that """"Belief in the psychological sense is a representational mental state that takes the form of a propositional attitude and in the religious sense, belief refers to a part of a wider spiritual or moral foundation, generally called faith, and that creationism is part and parcel of the christian faith, I think the use of the term """"belief"""" was completely justified. Creationism is indeed an explanation, but it is an explanation founded on belief, hence it is a belief. It is not founded on knowledge or evidence; to imply otherwise, which is what you're doing, is to create a false impression that Creationism shares some sort of parity with other explanations which do not require belief in the supernatural. It does not. You seem to be substituting your own personal bias for this imputed """"evolutionist bias"""" you claim is on the Creationism page.  16:48, 25 Aug 2004 (UTC)

And what do """"quanta"""" and """"cosmology"""" have in common?  Energy.  To simply categorize physics as """"the study of everything"""" is imperceptive.  When modeling sand falling into a pile (or nuts sorting in a jar) a physicist doesn't really care about the identity of the particles at hand, just certain """"bulk"""" properties that relate to its energetics.  The chemist tries to understand how the material composition in turn generates those energetic qualities, but then usually isn't capable of formulating the dynamic description of what happens when it's shaken (or spilled).  A physicst usually could care less about why niobium is better for a collider than copper, just that it is.  And chemists don't just care about chemical elements and compounds, there is a whole field of chemistry dedicated to monitoring interactions of nuclei with nucleons (nuclear chemistry)  still matter.  As a point of culture, chemists tend to focus on the diversity of matter and how that affects interactions with energy and physicists focus on the unity of energy, and how that affects matter.  Physical chemists very nicely bridge this  they put quite a bit of energetics while still caring deeply about the identity of that which is being studied.  While the duality may sound a bit contrived, there is definitely some truth to the statements, and while not perfect, it's more meaningful than what's there now."""

Fine, but keep in mind that this is not solely a matter of being NPOV- this is also a matter of accuracy.

Take a look at this FAQ on Eastern Catholiscim to see how the term is properly used: .

 your references are still not objective 

I can't believe that in your most recent edit you actually cited Tran Van Ba as your reference (""""recieved confirmation from Chancellor Tran Van Ba, last Colonel-in_chief for Emperor Bao Dai that Coat of Arms is correct""""). Tran Van Ba, according to his own statements, is the person you work for. In fact you have been editing from the same computer as Tran Van Ba. And we have no evidence, other than a large number of computer messages from an E-mail address bearing his name, that Tran Van Ba is who he says he is - and if he is, we have no evidence that what he says is true, except that he says it.

How many times do I have to say this? Tran Van Ba is not an objective source. He is not a book. He is not a newspaper. He is not a historian. He is one of the subjects of the article. He has a conflict of interest. You also have a conflict of interest, since you are (apparently) employed by him and by the family in question. And you expect us to accept your statements as fact simply because you say Tran Van Ba told you so?

This """"confirmation"""" is the same as if I said, """"The moon is made of green cheese because my mother, who has been to the moon, told me so."""" I could provide a million E-mails from my mother and that would still not be evidence.

Your repeated citations of various websites that simply refer to Mr. Nguyen as """"Prince"""" are equally irrelevant. They are simply repeating a claim that he has made, which has nothing to do with proving what Bao Dai said or did, or whether there is a Nguyen coat of arms. What you need is even one book or newspaper or magazine article - NOT a website - that mentions (a) a Nguyen coat of arms, or (b) Bao Dai bestowing an imperial title on anyone, an event that surely would have been recorded by someone at the time.

You say you are a lawyer. If so, you understand the meaning of evidence, citations, and research. If so, you are insulting our intelligence and attempting to deceive people, and I hope you will be banned from Wikipedia soon - if you do not simply give up and leave, since you seem to have no interest in anything other than this propaganda campaign. ← 16:41, 2004 Oct 21 (UTC)"""

Parentacide is the term used to describe a child killing one or both parents. Although the subject is as abhorrent as suicide or infantecide, it is a part of our life that cannot be dismissed.

Parentacide dates back to Greek mythology, where Oedipus killed his father Laius and married his mother Jocasta. Frued coined the term Oedipus complex to describe a state of psychosexual development and awareness first occuring at the age of 3 1/2 years.

In 1989 Lyle and Erik Menendez commited parentacide when they murdered both of their parents in cold blood. Although the murders were at least partially motivated by money, the brothers alleged their father had abused them, which was their justification for the killing.

Jeremy Bamber committed parentacide by proxy and was convicted in 1986 of killing his adoptive parents, sister, and her two six year old sons. Although money was thought to be the motive for this killing spree, the fact that he was adopted indicates that the reasons behind the murders were less clear cut. Being adopted, Bamber very likely suffered from adopted child syndrome, which is a psychological maladjustment to the knowledge that his real parents had given him up for adoption."
2cuvhdIC5c0Gg2hWs5Wsx0XKn2M=,"""I just think it's interesting how many revisions this has gone through ... here's the original 1911 """"Gutenberg"""" encyclopedia article that I pasted here originally, that has had the so-called """"Islamic bias"""" removed. I do know it needed editing, revising, expanding, and to be """"brought up to the times."""" Just something interesting to think about.

ALLAH, the Arabic name used by Moslems of all nationalities for the one true God. It is compounded of al, the definite article, and ilah, meaning a god.  The same word is found in Hebrew and Aramaic as well as in ancient Arabic (Sabaean).  The meaning of the root from which it is derived is very doubtful; cf.  Lane's Arabic-English Lexicon, p. 82, and the Oxford Hebrew and English Lexicon, pp. 61 ff.

 2002 

A previous version of the """"Allah"""" article included the following:
""""Allah"""" was also the proper name for the pre-Islamic god of the moon and travel worshiped by nomadic Arabic tribes. The name and has no femminine or plural forms. Allah was considered to be the ancestor and leader of the other gods, such as the goddesses al-Lat? and Man'at?

Anybody know why was this removed?

It seems that the moon god theory is heavily disputed and has limited support. It appears to be based on the poor quality work of only one man (Robert Mory) in the last 10 years.

Well, insofar as 'Allah' doubles as the name 'God' in Arabic we're up against the problem solved in English by capitalization, capital G for the monotheistic god of the Jews and Christians (who prefers that we NOT use his first name) versus the gods with a small G. """"Allah"""" was undoubtedly used about all SORTS of deities, and that's where the Moon-deity argument falls down.  And watch out about publishing the female-trinity bit  isn't that what got Salman Rushdie in trouble? Michael Tinkler.

I authored the paragraph about the moon-god theory. I read about this in """"Islam""""  by Jamal J. Elias, a Muslim author. The book is an intorduction to Islam from the POV of a liberal Muslim scholar. As Elias is Associate Professor of Religion at Amherst College, Massachusetts, and he writes on this theory as if it were fact, it seems there is more to this picture than the """"poor"""" work of one scholar. Therefore, I have restored the paragrah, with a note on it's contoversy.

I also authored the bit about Yahweh that was taken out. Critism accepeted, it belongs in its own article. So i have put it in Yahweh.  -  

It does seem true that Allah was the name of a moon god - and that Mohammed's father had allah as part of his name. But the name does have a feminine form - al Lat. It is not clear the connection of the moon god to the Muslim god.

Ok, first of all: Allah does simply mean """"the god"""", rather equivalent to our capitalized """"God"""". Hence, any major god (like this moon god, apparently) would have very likely been called """"God"""". I did some [admittely Internet-based] research on this topic just now, and clarified a few things in the actual text. Let me know how it reads now.

Here's a question. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a dictionary, so its articles should be about topics, not words per se. So is the """"Allah"""" article the appropriate place to provide a discussion of the Islamic concept of God? My initial thought would be yes.

But Arabic-speaking Christians would use the word to refer to the Christian God. Does that complicate the issue? Maybe. But one might argue that the wikipedia is in English (this one at least), and in English the word """"Allah"""" is generally used to refer to God specifically with reference to Islam. Right? So the discussion of the Islamic concept of God should be under """"Allah"""". Does this make sense? Anyone disagree?

Another question - Do Muslims take Allah to be the personal name for God or just the Arabic language word meaning God. This could be tricky since by way of comparison some Christians take Yahweh to be the personal name of God while others see it as just another description """"I am what I am"""" (If there is only one of a class, i.e. one God, why would he need a personal name?)

Well. In the listing I have that is based on Hadith (the teaching tradition of Islam), Allah is listed as the first name among the 99 names.  The names read more like titles """"the Compassionate, the Merciful, etc."""", but the tradition is that they are names.  I'll add the list as an entry. MichaelTinkler

Actually we already have a page under [[:ninety-nine names of Allah|ninety-nine names of Allah.

 Re: Thanks for restoring links 
Hi; you're quite welcome. I didn't think you removed the interlanguage links intentionally. The spam/vandalism was indeed added by 221.197.20.66—the same spammer/vandal returned today via 221.198.74.212. Since this is an obvious (and shameless) attempt to use Wikipedia to increase the page ranking of the spammer's website (see Wikipedia:Spam), I've put in a request at m:Non-development tasks for developers#Spam regex requests to have the domain shop263.com added to the project-wide spam filter. With any luck, a developer will see the request before too long. Once the domain is on the filter, a page containing the domain cannot be saved (annoyingly, there are ways to get around this, but it usually takes care of the problem).

 Zone system 

I would appreciate your leaving the mention in. First Ansel Adams, in his three volume 1980 basic photography series, presented the Zone system this way and he explicitly said, in so many words, that his aim is not to force his own system of photography on anyone, but to encourage photographers to better understand their equipment in order to control the finished photograph. He disapproved of winging it, not of any particular system. The Zone system worked for him. And the Zone system is controversial, believe it or not. I know of at least one vocational school photography teacher (years ago when I lived in Montreal) who told students not to bother with it, and it seems he was not alone. 

Also, please wait a few days before doing a major edit job. I liked the article as it used to be and I was sorely tempted to revert most of your changes, but did not. I particularly liked the wording """"dynamic range"""" and miss it, and I'm sorry to say I now personally find the article less approachable to a newcomer. 

Dynamic range is very appropriate: for instance (I'm making numbers up here for the sake of argument) if we say reality has a Zone 0 to X range of 1 to 100,000 , then a finished print has a range of 1 to 10,000 , while a typical digital camera will only provide a range of 1 to 1,000 . A move from 100,000 to 10,000 to 1,000 seems pretty dynamic to me...

However, since I'm not going to reread the whole Basic Photography series or even go into a darkroom again (space is at a premium in Tokyo) I'm not willing to put too much effort into maintaining this page.  05:52, 30 Sep 2004 (UTC)

Hi Vincent:
Which idea, specifically, did you wish to restore to the zone system article? That the zone system is/was not advocated by all? (I'd say that's probably true for most any school of thought.) That Ansel Adams was not dogmatic about this being the only way to do things? (I'd say that unless there is a large public misimpression that he was dogmatic it's not worth mentioning, no more than it's necessary to mention that every painter or sculptor or engineer held other approaches to various disciplines were equally valid.)

The statement that several natural languages have spatial tense as defined in the article is still an unsubstantiated claim, so imho it should be pulled out pending evidence. Part of the problem is the very name of the concept. 'Tense' has the connotation of 'time'. In fact, grammatical tense is frequently (if loosely) defined as 'location in time'. Thus, it doesn't really make sense to talk about 'spatial tense'; it would be like talking about 'temporal place'.
Since the only relevant use of the concept stems from Lojban grammar, I think it would be best to start the article out of the Lojban perspective, defining spatial tense as Lojban grammar defines it. And since spatial tense (according to Lojban grammar) is merely 'obligated expression of location', the broader context of the article should be the expression of space in language. And this is where observations about the connection between language and the way we perceive the world come in. The way I see it, the spatial cases of the Hopi language (one of the many languages that do very interesting things with space) don't really belong in an article about an invented, English-inspired, grammatical category. What we are really missing is a decent article about the way languages deal with location and space. Which is something I added to my to do list. —  (talk) 16:55, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)"

 practice is enlightenment
In Zen terms we say honsho myoshu. Honsho means intrinsic enlightenment; myoshu, subtle practice. We say practice and enlightenment, or realization, are one. How is it one thing? When you sit, your zazen is the zazen of the Buddhas. Your zazen is sitting Buddha, or Buddha's zazen. So your practice is realization itself, enlightenment itself. Your zazen becomes anuttara samyak sambodhi itself. Have this kind of faith. 
Usually when you do zazen, zazen becomes a cause to create some kind of effect, such as enlightenment, frustration, anger, or whatever arises. That is the wrong way to do zazen. Your practice is not something by which you attain some place else or something else. Your practice itself is a fulfillment of honsho myoshu, the originally enlightened life."

Hi!

I'm writing to let you know that the Wikimedia Board of Trustees has approved the first stage of the Wikinews project. There's now a fully operational English demo site at demo.wikinews.org. This will be used for experimenting with various review models and basic policies before the site is launched officially in about a week. demo.wikinews.org will become the English version later.
 
You voted for the Wikinews project, so I'm asking for your participation now. Everything is open, nothing is final. What Wikinews will and can be depends in large part on you. There already is a global Wikinews mailing list for discussing the project. If you are interested at all, please subscribe  coordination is of key importance. There's also an IRC channel #wikinews on irc.freenode.net. Realtime discussion can help to polish up articles.
 
If you're looking for something to do, check out the articles in development and articles in review. Or start a new story in the Wikinews workspace, or ignore the proposed review system - it's up to you. I hope you'll join us soon in this exciting experiment. 01:59, Nov 17, 2004 (UTC)"

Their conclusion was that the god of the old testament (referred to as Yahweh) and the God of the new testament (referred to as God (in Greek)) were not the same. They further considered that not only was Yahweh evil, but Yahweh is the source of all evil, i.e. the devil. They considered the serpent to be the good god.

 that's exactly it, i think.  it's a paradigm difference.  some people see creationism as morally and factually wrong because of their PARADIGM, and others see it as morally and factually right because of THEIR paradigm.  and they're throwing falsifiability and bias and everything else at each other ... but when it comes down to it, it's a PARADIGM difference.  At the same time, however, one, the other, or something else IS factually true.  And so what SCIENCE needs to do is keep as BROAD a paradigm as possible in allowing itself to go through the process of falsification.  A scientific community that ASSUMES Genesis is true will be limited in its ability to falsify itself ... because it will always say, """"well ... we just haven't figuredn out how to justify that assumption yet  but we will!""""  Similarly, a scientific community that ASSUMES God does not exist will say the same thing.  I think what science needs to do is take a position of NEUTRALITY regarding the hypotheses of a creator  and allow falsification to take its course.

 where this leads me is this.  the falsifiable assertions of evolution are: """"Evolution is false where there are clear and distinct boundaries between """"kinds,"""" across which macroevolution cannot occur"""" and """"evolution is false where life, by its very nature, can never arise from non-life.""""  In my opinion, IF the theory is falsified in that way, ID becomes the """"improved theory""""  because it takes ALL the contemporary evidence that is explained by evolution, AND explains abiogenesis and macroevolution  making it that new path integral formulation to F=ma.

However, ID requires the PARADIGM shift that there IS a creator.

 Article Licensing 

Whenever I need a WikiVacation, sometimes I go back to working on articles that absolutely no one would think to write about so they leave me alone.

A secondary, but equally important, goal is to get those users to release ALL of their edits for ALL articles.  I've personally chosen to multi-license all of the  and  contributions under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike License so that other projects, such as WikiTravel, can use our articles.  I was wondering if you would be willing to multi-license all your contributions (or at minimum those on the geographic articles) so that we can keep most of the articles available under the multi-license.  Many users use the {{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}} template (or even {{MultiLicensePD}} for public domain) on their user page, but there are other templates for other options at Template messages/User namespace.  If you only prefer using the GFDL, I understand, but I thought I'd at least ask, just in case, since the number of your edits is in the top 100.  If you do want to do it, simply just copy and paste one of the above two templates into your user page and it will allow us to track those users who have done it. For example:

Mustafaa, I promised much more stuff but have been too busy lately.
One thing that sticks out and could be fixed quickly is the beginning of the invasion.
Yes, it is my fault for adding only the Argov incident, which now makes it sounds as if it was the main reason for invasion, which is of course wrong. So, the sentence:
 """"On 1982-06-06 Israel invaded Lebanon in response to the attempted assassination of Israeli Ambassador Shlomo Argov by Abu Nidal in London on June 4.""""
should be expanded. This is a quickie list of basic facts:
 Israel had been bombing Lebanon/PLO for months, from the air, sea and land; and preparing for the invasion (see below, they couldn't have pulled of the invasion in a matter of days otherwise.)
 There was the attempted assassination Shlomo Argov ...
 The assassination attempt was used by Begin as an impetus to shortcut the Knesset's debate and move into Lebanon without full approval. 
 Israel invaded with 60,000 troops.

Also, I edited the wording of the one sentence that said """"Currently (site name I forgot) has over 200 programs, I added a specific date, so that the article ages a bit easier."""

 Article Licensing 

Hi, I've  to get users to multi-license all of their contributions that they've made to either (1) all U.S. state, county, and city articles or (2) all articles, using the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike  (CC-by-sa) v1.0 and v2.0 Licenses or into the public domain if they prefer.  The CC-by-sa license is a true free documentation license that is similar to Wikipedia's license, the GFDL, but it allows other projects, such as WikiTravel, to use our articles.  Since you are among the top 1000 Wikipedians by edits, I was wondering if you would be willing to multi-license all of your contributions or at minimum those on the geographic articles.  Over 90% of people asked have agreed.  For More Information:
Multi-Licensing FAQ - Lots of questions answered
Multi-Licensing Guide

To allow us to track those users who muli-license their contributions, many users copy and paste the """"{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}"""" template into their user page, but there are other options at Template messages/User namespace.  The following examples could also copied and pasted into your user page:

Option 1
I agree to [[Wikipedia:Multi-licensing|multi-license]] all my contributions, with the exception of my user pages, as described below:
{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}
OR
Option 2
I agree to [[Wikipedia:Multi-licensing|multi-license]] all my contributions to any [[U.S. state]], county, or city article as described below:
{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}

Or if you wanted to place your work into the public domain, you could replace """"{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}"""" with """"{{MultiLicensePD}}"""".  If you only prefer using the GFDL, I would like to know that too.  Please let me know what you think at my talk page.  It's important to know either way so no one keeps asking.

Canadian Red Ensign

I am ArmChairVexillologistDon,

I am a hobbiest in Heraldy, and Vexillology,
I am very well read on those subjects.

Yesterday I noted a slanderous reference, linking the Canadian Red Ensign to Neo-Facists groups.  I did not appreciate the reference, not one little bit.  I posted some information in that regard.  Specifically a web-site link to the Great Canadian Flag Debate.   The Canadian Government uncharacteristically saw fit to keep an accurate archive, detailing those important events.

At any rate, you decided to remove my """"contribution"""".  However you decided to leave the """"disputed"""" reference linking the Canadian Red Ensign to the Neo-Facists groups.  I was not pleased that you choose to remove my """"contribution"""", and then decided that the Neo-Facist comment could stay.

I decided then, if my comments were to go, then the Neo-Facist comments were to go as well.  I thus have deleted them.

I don't usually get involved in things such as this, but Heraldy and Vexillology are two of my dearest passions.  So, my comments are gone fine, but why was the Neo-Facist comment left by you?

Your inconsistent view points on references for cults and hate groups
In talk:cult you say that the checklists must go because they are unscientific, though they are clearly mentioned as disputed and attributed to the anti-cult movement. The one by Lifton is referenced. I support replacement of the other checklist by the one by Eileen Barker.  12:45, 3 Oct 2004 (UTC)
In talk:hate group you support a checklist presented as proven fact that is unattributed, but just made up and you oppose my view that the checklist must be referenced.  12:45, 3 Oct 2004 (UTC)

I may miss something but it seems that you use double standards to support your views. I hope that your can re-consider your opinions about references for checklists on these subjects. Thanks in advance.  12:39, 3 Oct 2004 (UTC)

Good point, Andries. I do not have a problem with these checklists if they are placed in the destructive cults article.  19:07, 3 Oct 2004 (UTC)
Zappaz, thanks for you changing your opinion. The problem is, I think, that it is difficult to distinguish between a harmless NRM, a cult and a destructive cult. That is why I think the checklists are important and should stay in the cult article, or at least directly linked to. I mean, my former group has some destructive/exploiting traits, which I only found out after nine years. Besides many scholars, the media and the public do not make the distinction between a cult and a destructive cult.  19:19, 3 Oct 2004 (UTC)

That is exactly the reason: the media and the public do not make that distinction. My hope is that the Wikipedia articles can throw some neutral light into that confusion. That is my hope. With your help and the help of other editors editing those articles, we have a good chance to suceed in doing that. And that would be a wonderful thing.  01:10, 4 Oct 2004 (UTC)

Regarding your complaints about Andries' behavior
May be it is because of my English but I think I was the co-author of the Criticism of Prem Rawat article. So were you. So was Jossi. I admit that Gary D was the main author. May be I am confused because of the subtle language differences between Dutch and Engish. Same for e.g. the word """"study"""" that has a slightly different meaning when compared to the Dutch word """"studie"""", which was, in hindsight, the reason for one of my many disputes with Jossi.  23:06, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)

I only said on talk:past teachings of Prem Rawat that I do not understand you. In fact, I defended you against Jim's accusations.  23:06, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)

I checked what I wrote on forum8 about you the last 60 days and I could only find the following post by me in which I defended you. http://www.forum8.org/forum8/posts/7621.html  23:06, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)

I really do not understand why you think that my behavior towards you is inappropriate.  23:06, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Zappaz, I think we have to concentrate on articles to prevent endless and senseless discussions. I do not think that we will ever agree about your complaints about my behavior.  01:26, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)

I clearly see that you do not want to take responsibility for your actions. Fair enough.  05:35, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Zappaz, I do take responsibility for my words. I write here under my real name and I even clarified my words outside Wikipedia upon your request here in Wikipedia. This is far more than the guidelines in Wikipedia or its spirit demand.  18:30, 12 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Besides, I did not make a cloaked accusation towards you. I had no other intention than to defend both Jim and you.  What can I do to convince you of that? In that post I explicitly wrote that I believed you to be sincere. It is not my fault that you go far beyond the literal meaning of what I wrote there and suspect that I made a cunning attack on your credibility. It took me even a while before I understood to what extent you had misinterpreted what I wrote.  18:30, 12 Nov 2004 (UTC)

I am pleased that others have joined this enquiry but I am already dismayed to find that someone has found it necessary to sweep the """"Jewish Question"""" under the carpet when reference on this Talk page had already been made to one incident involving a """"Final Solution"""" of the Jews in England. I like those terms because they shock the conscience in that everyone knows what those terms mean with regards to Germany in the 1930s and 1940s. It was the passage of the so-called """"Race laws"""" of the 30s that led to the Holocaust of the 40s - there was a cause and effect.

Now with that preface out of the way I am stating that the 1215 Magna Carta contains the smoking gun of England's own move to rid the Isles of the Jews. This is not hidden history but well documented history. It is just not talked about because the English (I am English) don't want to be thought of as being antisemitic, but English history reeks of antisemitism.

What is not being addressed here (and even less now that someone has added the censor's touch), is that the Pope of Rome (there were other Popes), controlled England through his king; church and law (there was no secular law as such that was not santioned by the Church and the Church was the one Church based in Rome. I hope everyone knows about Henry VIII so that I don't have to explain that as well.)

So the Jews were moneychangers. Why were they moneychangers? Go and do your own research! You need to know. The Jews had a moneychanger relationship with the Church and that is why the clause is in there: the Jews were (are) not Christians (duh!) - not members of the Church of Rome. The Pope gave them special status. The representative for all of the wheeler-dealing was the Archbishop. The barons were merely local gangsters, or in today's understanding = warlords (thugs.)

The statements about the Jews in Magna Carta was not intended to educate readers as to who the Jews were - everyone knew who the Jews were. They were the People of the blood libel (""""they killed Jesus""""). The Church whose Jesus the Jews killed put up with them like the Nazis used Jews when it suited them and some Jews (a few) went along with the Nazis to save themselves at the expense of the majority of Jews. This is the thorny issue we are dealing with. Under English law the Jews were forbidden to do practically anything else but be moneychangers! They were the scum of society and the Church had a need for a sub-class of human beings. The Jews did not have the same status as everyone else and the Jews were murdered and abused. Because of the holier than thou attitude towards ethnic cleansing in the world today, the English do not want to admit that they were at it long before Herr Hitler got into the business!

Now move along to 1297 and """"bingo!"""" = no Jews. Why? Because they were kicked out of England, forced to go underground or convert. Same thing happened in Spain. (Hello, isn't that what happened in Nazi Germany?) It was not until the time of Cromwell - long after Henry VIII told the Pope bye, bye and long after Shakespeare wrote his own infamous words about a moneylending Jew that Cromwell talked about religious tolleration. Why? Because Cromwell ruled the English Republic which had severed its relationship with the Church by chopping off the head of the king; abolishing the House of Lords and raiding all of the Church properties to put them out of business. Then the forces of the Republic went to Ireland and engaged in """"ethnic cleansing"""" by wholesale murder and mayhem.

Read your history. Move up to the time of 18th Century and read about the status of Jews in Parliament (how and when they were finally allowed to sit in Parliament.)

The bottom line. The Magna Carta of 1215 needs to be explained: who wrote it and why and what it says and why. What we have here on Wiki right now is pure boring propaganda that explains nothing. But by looking at the clauses dealing with the Jews you can see that while the English may get on their high horses and yell about the evil Germans (remember the UK Royals are German are hiding under another name since WWI), then it is possible to gulp and say """"me too"""" (in English) and understand that evil knows no race or religion.  16:12, 18 Dec 2004 (UTC)"""

death to critics

So instead of  'every' earlier, now you are giving isolated cases, such as Theo van Gogh, Vincent van Gogh, Rashad Khalifa, and Irshad Manji who received death threats or were killed by anonymous unknown radicals.  What happened to every claim? Anyway, to prove your case that Islam sanctions death sentence to its critics, you can't just post the names of isolated cases where people received death threats from anonymous radicals! You need to post the names of prominent Islamic scholars and universities such as Al Azhar (not isolated radicals) who issued the death sentence against these people. The fatwa  against Rushdie was rejected by Al Azhar and all countries except Iran. So all you need to do is post Islamic sites (not anti-Islamic sites and isolated radical sites) who issued the death sentence against Menji, Rashad Khalifa, Theo van Gogh, etc. Bring your proof. Just throwing the names of isolated cases where someone received death threats from isolated anonymous radical doesn't prove Islam sanctions death sentence to it's critics! After 9/11, many Muslims and mosques received threats and some Muslims/Sikhs were even killed. That doesn't mean the US sanctions death to all American Muslims.  You are such a pathetic joke, dude!  Posting isolated cases where people received death threats from anonymous radicals doesn't prove a thing. We don't even know for sure who killed Rashad. You added even his name. You need to post the names of Muslim scholars who issues death sentence against, say, Rashad, Vincent van Gogg, and Menji. Then you need to post evidence that this was consensus among Muslim scholars on each of these cases.  Without that, you don't have any case, and you are refuted once again  09:33, 30 Nov 2004 (UTC)

I also provided examples of critics who were murdered by MUHAMMAD himself. Al-Azhar is not a higher authority than Muhammad.

No, you have only provided two stories in Ibn Ishaq about Muhammad that are rejected by Muslims, such as rejected here.  Al Azhar and Muslim scholars will interpret what Muhammad did and what Islamic law says, not an anti-Islamic bigot like you. You made a bold claim that in Islam critics are to be to be killed. I refuted that by giving examples that contradict that. You then claimed that every critic received a death sentence. You were refuted again. You then posted a list of isolated critics such as Rushdie, Menji, Rashad Khalifa, Theo van Gogh, etc, who received death threats from anonymous radicals. That's like posting (a much longer list) of Muslims/Sikhs who received death threats or were killed after 9/11, and claiming that American law allows Muslims to be killed. You were refuted again.  You need to provide names of prominent well known Muslim scholars (not anti-Islam sites or isolated radicals) for each of these cases and prove that they issued the death sentence. After that, you need to provide proof that that judgement was a consensus among Muslims scholars. You didn't do that. You were refuted once again. Since you are an anti-Islamic bigot, you can't just claim that Muhammad did this or that or Islamic law says this or that and expect that claim to be inserted in Encyclopedia.

Furthermore, whe opinons of secular governments are irrelevant - of course Musilm countries rejected the death fatwa against Rushdie, but this was due to international politics, not due to religion. Also, as stated before, Ayatollah Khomenie was a Shiah CLERIC. The only way to be an Ayatollah is to be born as one. Aside from being the dictator or IRan, Khomenie was also the spiritial and religious leader of huge numbers of Sha'ias around the world. Khomenie wrote many fatwas and books about Islam. His most famous fatwa, of course, calls for the murder of Salman Rushdie. Now Al-Azhar - a SUNNI university  SUPPOSEDLY rejected KHomenei's teachings. This does not mean by any means prove that Al-Azhar was right, and Khomenie was wrong. The fact that KHomenie was a shiah cleric, while Al-Azhar is a sunni university is also a  gaping hole in this argument. You have no ev"

 OneGuy's vanadalism of the discussion page 
Aside from OneGuy deleting other user's comments, he has now begun to blatently disorganize and effectively vanadalize people's comments: he distrupting the flow of users' comments by arbitrarily cutting off paragraphs and inserting his comments in between, instead of being civil and adding his reply to the end of a given post. Combined with his ceasless personal attacks, false accusations, and insistance on making wikipedia a propoganda machine for Islamist apologetics of the blackest kind, his behaviour has become completely intolerable, and I do not see any point in constantly refuting the same false accusations and false assertions over and over again. OneGuy must be ejected from this discussion before it can have any hope of being a civiled and productive debate. I am left with no choice but to completely resign from this discussion, since it seems that no one is going to be moderating OneGuy's behaviour anytime soon.  Pename

What's ironic is that OneGuy claims he is not a muslim and therefore can not be considered an Islamic apologist!  In fact, most of the Muhammad/Islam apologists here claim to not be Muslim!  Looks like Muhammad's best friends are the infidels.  

As of moderating OneGuy's behavior, the Arbitrators are looking into him and myself after he filed a hypocritical arbitration request against me and I thus filed a countercomplaint against OneGuy.  Whenever OneGuy spots someone who doesn't agree with his radical apologistic viewpoint he tries to silence them by any means at his disposal.  OneGuy, in his complaint in arbitration, accused me of rivert(sic) wars and having POV in my contributions yet he does the exact same thing, only more so.  In the arbitration complaint, the arbitrators don't seem as concerned about the POV contributions as they do about personal attacks, revert wars and my vandalism of his user page. See Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/168.209.97.34.  When OneGuy was giving evidence against me he incorrectly called a few minor word changes as a revert war (even though the change were only made once or twice) and he clearly left out the revert wars in which he was involved (but the arbitrators were not fooled - they found him out).

Since the arbitrators will probably not do anything about his radical apologistic contributions, they will most likely respond to his vandalism of the talk pages.  Feel free to post your complaints regarding OneGuy on Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/168.209.97.34/Evidence.    06:56, 9 Dec 2004 (UTC)

 Since when replying on talk page has become vandalism? Only one time I deleted Pename comments when he cut and pasted his comments that were already on the page on top of my response in a new section that I created (""""death to critics""""). Pename has ignored what we are discussing and is resorting to personal insults and false accusations (in violation of wiki policy) that I vandalized the talk page. He now claims that he did not copy the verse from anti-Islamic site. If true, where did he find the interpretation that 8:67 means kill prisoners of war? He implied that interpretation in the article. At worst, the verse condemns the behavior of taking prisoners in order to make money, but he has not given his source that says 8:67 means kill prisoners. Instead of answering where he found that interpretation (if not anti-Islamic site), Pename is resorting to personal insults and outright lies that I vandalized the talk page  18:46, 6 Dec 2004 (UTC)

 First victim of what? Biri's death is not part of the al-Aqsa Intifada because the intifada started after his death - after Ariel Sharon's visit to the al-Aqsa site. You see, that's how it got the name """"al-Aqsa"""". The Israeli government propaganda repeated at the websites you list claims that the Palestinians started the al-Aqsa intifada before Sharon even visited the al-Aqsa site. Even the """"Palestine Facts"""" source you cite and the objective Mitchell report point to Sharon's visit as the trigger for the al-Aqsa intifada. Of course there is constant violence in the area so anyone can name his own start date. We can go back to 1948 or 1917 if you want. It does no service to Wikipedia to throw Israeli government propaganda into the article. ( I am sure that won't stop you though).

""""On September 28, 2000, Ariel Sharon marched defiantly and provocatively through the Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, touching off the current round of violence. """"   

The Mitchell Report:
""""Mr. Sharon made the visit on September 28 accompanied by over 1,000 Israeli police officers. Although Israelis viewed the visit in an internal political context, Palestinians saw it as highly provocative to them. On the following day, in the same place, a large number of unarmed Palestinian demonstrators and a large Israeli police contingent confronted each other. According to the U.S. Department of State, """"Palestinians held large demonstrations and threw stones at police in the vicinity of the Western Wall. Police used rubber-coated metal bullets and live ammunition to disperse the demonstrators, killing 4 persons and injuring about 200.""""[4] According to the GOI, 14 Israeli policemen were injured.[5] Similar demonstrations took place over the following several days.[6] Thus began what has become known as the """"Al-Aqsa Intifada"""" (Al-Aqsa being a mosque at the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount). """"  

Furthermore, in the article Terrorism_against_Israel_in_2000#August, it says Biri died in August after being attacked by """"terrorists"""". (If Biri was an Israeli soldier in occupied Gaza, why are his attackers called """"terrorists"""" in Wikipedia?).

Yossi Tabaji and several unnamed Palestinian youth were also killed in the days before the """"official start"""" of the al-Aqsa intifada because there are constant killings almost every day in the conflict. The al-Aqsa intifada is an upsurge in the violence that started after Sharon's visit to the al-Aqsa site. That is the commonly understood definition of al-Aqsa intifada.

In many such cases, the text as you find it has come into being after long and arduous negotiations between Wikipedians of diverse backgrounds and points of view. An incautious edit to such an article can be akin to stirring up a hornet's nest, and other users who are involved in the page may react angrily.

If you encounter an article on a controversial subject that you would like to edit, first read the comments on the talk page and view the Page history to get a sense of how the article came into being and what its current status is.

If you are an experienced wiki-ist, you will probably have a good sense what will be accepted edits, and which edits should be discussed first.

If you are new to wikipedia, or unsure how others will view your proposals, and you want to change or delete anything substantial in the text, you should either:

   1. If the material in question is a sentence or so in length, copy it to the Talk page and list your objections there.
   2. If the material is longer than a sentence, list your objections on the Talk page but leave the main article as it is.

Then, wait a bit for responses. If no one objects, proceed. But always move large deletions to Talk and list your objections to the text so that other people will understand your changes and will be able to follow the history of the page.

Also, show respect for consensus. Avoid making major changes to an article if a vote (or poll) is currently in progress about whether those changes should be made, especially if there is no clear consensus shown by the vote.

This all sounds good, although I'd be happier if the Indo-European stuff stuck around as a section.  Most of the readers of en.wikipedia do in fact speak one or more Indo-European languages and many of them are young people on school assignment, who may want some concrete examples.  Of course making the article a more complete survey of tense in general, in all known languages, is a big yes.

I support the idea of wikicode. Basically I think we should present code in a Python-like language that doesn't carry so much baggage. For example, we can use English sentences (or sentence fragments) instead of requiring the reader to understand some obscure Python library. (Further, Python has the baggage that there are no block-terminators: i.e., no """"}"""" or """"end""""s or """"fi""""s or """"repeat""""s. By adding such terminators, we can make it a lot less ambiguous to all readers.) In otherwords, we're basically right on track: removing the quirks of Python, and making it higher-level.

I am perfectly glad, and have been all along, to see this section totally removed from this article. When we spun out the fuller version of this, I wanted to delete this shortened version from here. However, if it stays, I remain concerned what it says, and you and I obviously disagree about that.

 As for your """"obviously"""": Once again, you seem to be reading sentences out of context. Look at the context of this passage (italics added for emphasis):

""""There was division within the left as to the invasion of Afghanistan.  Nonetheless, an international anti-war movement began to arise; in the U.S. and other countries whose governments enacted legislation analogous to the PATRIOT Act, it was equally a movement in protest of what were perceived to be assaults on civil liberties and immigrant rights.""""

""""Most prominent in this loose coalition were...""""

This is specifically about the protest movement at the time of the Afghanistan invasion (and was more exclusively so in earlier versions, because someone has now inserted """"and Iraq"""" in the next sentence). You say there was no anti-Afganistan-invasion-movement worth mentioning. Don't know where you were. I was in London at the time. 50,000 of us were in Trafalgar Square, that's usually considered a large enough protest to be worth mentioning. I can't say for sure how large rallies were elsewhere at the time, but these links are suggestive: , . Here's a statement of protest by a Canadian Senator on October 26, 2001.. It would take a lot of time to really document the level of protest activity at that time, and it was certainly not nearly as much as later over Iraq, but it is much more relevant to the topic of the Left, becuase opposition was narrower and the Left had a more prominent role.   | Talk 07:16, Jan 4,"""

Alternative Judaism
Zain, I think that Alternative Judaism is a good place to put the disclaimer about other religious groups that claim they are Jews, but I do think it is worth looking at the links a bit further, since I think you might have misread some of them. Also, remember that there is a difference between claiming descent from the """"Israelites"""" and actually claiming to be practicing Judaism.  Here are the links you keep using to illustrate your points, and that you added to the article:

 Anglo-Israelism  Never claimed to be Jews, they claim that the English are the descendents of the lost tribes of Israelites.  Nowhere on their site do they claim to be Jewish or practicing Judaism. I do not think there is a good argument that these people are Jews in any way.  They can and are identified in the Ten Lost Tribes article.
 Christian Identity  Weird choice.  They hate Jews, look at the text of the article, where they explicitly condemn Judaism as evil. Certainly not an alternative form of Judaism, nor are they Jews.
 Talmidaism  A subset of Christianity, or possibly Messianic Judaism, which is already in the article.
 Nazarene A subset of Messianic Judaism, which is already in the article
 Messianic Judaism  Already in the article that you edited
 Judaizing teachers  Refers to a movement of early Christians, not a current group.  This is like including Jews Harp in the list - it is a reference to a historical label, not a religion.
 Jews for Jesus  Already in the article that you edited
 Messianic Renewed Judaism  A minor subset of Messianic Judaism
 Lost Ten Tribes  Not a religion, but another good place to put these sort of links
 British-Israel-World Federation  See Anglo-Israelism

I asked about sources out of curiosity, not to undermine what you said.  In a Jamaican context what you say is true - from what I cited (and some other reading) I would say that """"Taino"""" is preferable to Arawak for the Greater Antilles because it is more specific in that context.  Taino is used specifically for the Arawakan people of the northern Caribbean - so it is a subset of the Arawakan people (and thus not interchangeable).  Taino could be considered a single """"tribe"""" within the Arawakan language family.  The Island Caribs were another, as were the Lokono of the mainland.  The Arawakan language family is one of the largest in South America - Brazil, Peru, Bolivia and throughout the Caribbean.  The term Taino is not, to my knowledge, used for groups outside of the northern Caribbean.
The Arawakan people of Hispaniola and Puerto Rico had the most sophisticated cultures, the most powerful chiefdoms.  As far as I can tell, it is to these groups (the """"classic Taino"""") plus their related neighbours (the """"eastern Taino"""" and the """"western Taino"""") that they name Taino applied.  The point is not the word as such, since it was probably not a word that they used for themselves except to proclaim themselves """"friendlies"""" to the Spanish.  There was a distinct culture of the northern Caribbean...before I looked it up I though the Lucayans of the Bahamas were not part of that group, but I was wrong.  Words only work if they can be fit to real meaningful concepts.
The term """"Igneri"""" has been used for the """"Island Arawaks"""" who preceded the Island Caribs in the Lesser Antilles.  This group probably made up the basic substratum of the Island Carib population, and gave rise to the """"Kalinago"""" (or women's language) of the Island Caribs.  The men spoke either a Carib language or a Carib-based pidgin, but apparently it had a lot of Arawak words.
The """"traditional"""" view of the Island Caribs as interlopers has been severely questioned in recent times.  One source separated out three theories of their origin.  The traditional one (and the one I got in school, etc.) was the """"Carib replacement"""" model - that the Caribs invaded and displaced the original Arawak population of the Lesser Antilles, and were spreading northward at the time of Spanish contact.  Another one is the """"Arawak continuity"""" model which says that the Arawaks of the Lesser Antilles acquired a Carib pidgin through trading with the Mainland Caribs.  The third is a reticulate model in which Mainland Caribs moved into the Lesser Antilles and merged with the Arawak population in a model comparable to the Norman conquest of England.  I got the impression that modern scholars leaned that way.  One source cited seventeenth century documents that refer to two groups of """"Caribs"""" in Grenada, the Galini (probably Kaliña/Karinya, or Mainland Caribs) and the Caraïbes (Island Caribs).  In addition, contemporary sources refer to the Taino of the Greater Antilles fleeing Spanish massacres and joining the Island Caribs.  In the Spanish period the Island Caribs changed from being enemies of the Puerto Rican Tainos to being their allies against the Spanish.  (Main source: Raiders and Traders: Caraïbe Social and Political Networks at the Time of European Contact and Colonization in the Eastern Caribbean - Ann Cody Holdren, 1998, Ph.D. dissertation, UCLA; McGinnis's dissertation - cited above - has a lot of quotes from Columbus's journals and from other contemporary sources).
Arawak (or aruaca), as I mentioned, comes from aru which was the Lokono word for cassava flour.  
I am not a historian, just trying to do my best to see what the primary literature says.  The use of the word Taino is standard for the Greater Antilles, but whether it is """"accurate"""" is another matter altogether.  McGinnis points out that Columbus was very selective in how he interpreted data - if you were hostile, then human limbs were proof you were Carib, but if you were friendly, then the heads he found in the village was funerary.  Of course the whole idea of the origin of the Caribs is controvertial.  But the traditional view is by no means accepted without question.  That's what makes history so exciting these days.   23:40, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)"""

If you have any doubts, then check the discussion page for that article.

This is massive material. It tends to overwhelm the article, which is now bloated to three times the recommended size of a Wikipedia article. I think we need to summarize here and factor out to separate articles, maybe one for each year.
While clearly well researched, the material is quite POV in the selection of what it covers. I'm firmly on the side of the Republic  one of the first things I ever learned to say in Spanish was """"Sueño y una ametralladero y Franco se va paseo,  but this Wikipedia articles are not the place for partisan polemic. A chronology this detailed should also include the anti-Catholic atrocities by anarchists and other supporters of the Republic. This doesn't.
The material is written in indifferent English. Right now, I'm engaged in a copy edit, which is being made difficult by the size of this article and the current miserable state of the servers.
I do not think it is appropriate in Wikipedia to repeatedly refer to the Nationalists as """"the Fascists"""".  Would I call them that in my own writing outside Wikipedia? Sure. And someone on the Right would probably use different words than """"Republicans"""", """"legitimate government"""", etc. in his/her own writing. Here, I'd favor """"Nationalists"""" or """"Insurgents"""" almost everywhere that the article currently says """"Fascists"""". Does anyone want to present an argument to the contrary?

It depends whether we want Wikipedia to be cutting-edge. It is clear to anyone studying Time Cube that Dr Ray's discovery of the Ineffable 4-Corner Truth renders him worthy of the positions of Greatest Thinker and Wisest Human; he is thus granted the authority to bestow a doctorate upon himself. The only reason not to recognise this doctorate is compliance with the general stupidity that has precluded rapid acceptance of Time Cube.

Well, I myself am not so keen on dumbing down Wikipedia for the stupid and closed-minded people; although some people do seem to be, as evidenced by the censorship of the following material:

In late 2004, and in the midst of a prolific period of Time Cube evaluation marked by his creation of new and inspirational Cubic scriptures, Dr Ray took the Cubic disproof of religious concepts to the next level, by solving the major philosophical question: """"Why something rather than nothing?"""" The answer, as published by him on his Time Cube website, related to the principle of opposites (in this case, static rather than dynamic/cyclical opposites), an important element of Cubic geometry: """"Between the opposites, all things are created. As an entity, they exist only as a big zero, seen from space as something and nothing from every possible view.""""

It appears that the religious zealots want there to be a lack of solution for """"Why something rather than nothing?"""", so that they can use it as a proselytisation/brainwashing tactic. Thus, when the solution is revealed, they cover it up as part of their efforts to prevent awareness of the Cubic Truth, which, as we know, disproves God and exposes religion as an evil Word-scam. 

It seems a pity, but in reality, great things don't come easy. We must all fight to break the Word-shackles of religious and Academic-induced 1-corner ignorance, and force teachers to teach Cubicism above evil cubelessness. Humanity's sole hope of salvation lies with 4-corner Cubic knowledge."""

XiL95A0Es0y9YYRGUwPI4NU6n7U=,"I wonder why you think it's absurd to a) try and raise funds for those harmed by a natural disaster and b) to prove once and for all that these repetitive - almost chanting - claims I am Ennis are false. If the 'Number is Ennis' dichotomy was removed the Talk Pages would be near empty! I wonder why you condemn my attempts to bring honesty to these pages.

But, that's rhetorical - as I said, there must be certain camaraderie among Wiki people and I doubt if you’d want to jeopardise that even if your quest was integrity.

Now you have asked me a sensible question, so I'll answer.

For some time I watched these pages and saw that posts from people in the UK/claiming they were in the UK were summarily dismissed. Worse, posters were automatically accused of being Ennis.

One reason given was that the posts were anonymous.

So I thought, as I know more about Ennis than others from the UK posting here (IMO) I'd try to add to these pages. However, even with an identity, I got exactly the same treatment. In fact Cardinal Chunder also got the same treatment even though he has an anti-Sollog website and is well known in Google groups for arguing with sollog(ites).

So it became clear that it would be impossible to add anything constructive unless either the accusations 'You're a sock puppet! You’re Ennis!' were either suppressed or disproved.

I therefore asked what the criteria would be to 'prove' I was not Ennis - and presumably this criteria would apply to others. 

I tried to prove I was not in America (I thought these days all IPs were traceable but perhaps the 'proxy argument' holds sway - though quite how 'proxies work' is beyond me) I quoted extracts from a newspaper that was not on the net.

This was dismissed.

Someone else even went to a pub in Lyndhurst and posted what was next to where he was sitting.

That too was dismissed.

So it became obvious that no proof I (or anyone else) was not Ennis would ever be accepted.

Therefore the only other option if I felt I had something to contribute would be to suppress the hyena-like accusations (never backed up BTW)

In vain did I quote Wiki Official Policy. Plainly it is not obeyed by Editors/Administrators vis a vis the treatment of contributors.

So what is left? I cannot invoke Wiki policy. I cannot 'prove' I am here, in England sitting quietly in front of a PC.

Two choices.

Stop posting completely

Try and 'challenge' the main accuser so once and for all this behaviour would stop. The only challenge worth it would be one where I did not personally gain (Of course I would win because I am not Ennis) and where proof involving a third party held in esteem (e.g. Ashley) acted as 'witness'.

Hence the challenge.

I fear that will be deleted; I'll be castigated a usual and that's that. It really is just hopeless.

I have started deleting all my posts and if the challenge is reverted I’ll know there simply is no hope and I'll delete all my posts if I can find them.

You see, unless people accept I am not Ennis everything I or anyone else writes who is similarly accused will simply be dismissed. I'd prefer it if people read the post without looking at the poster - but they don't.

I have other interests - I posted on the Yoga page but it's quiet and I am interested in politics etc etc.

So we'll see what happens. Like I said, my view is that it's just hopeless trying to treat others as adults as all some want to do is - and they admit this - bait, bait and bait and if you do rise to it you're banned and if you don't it shows your inability. Truly a page that brings out the juvenile in what I assume are adults.

So there you are. I have answered your question fully and honestly and we'll just see what happens. It will answer the question - at least for these Sollog pages - as to whether Wiki should be taken seriously or not.

Finally if, as expected, the post is reverted it will provide a fitting end to the article I am writing (I am a freelance writer and no, I’m not going to prove it) before I send it off to newspapers. If it is accepted though I shall return just the once, to link to the article!   16:57, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)"

Please could you tell me where I complain to and also perhaps you'd do it if you can do it easily, please delete every single post I have ever made on the Talk Sollog pages as it's pointless trying to do anything there. I'd be better off elsewhere.

When I saw the edits and MPLX's addition yesterday, I found it rather anti-GWB (which I happen to share, but...) POV and unfounded. The connection seems absurdly weak and tenuous; for decades if not centuries politicians all the world over have been speaking of peace while waging or preparing war, and assuring the populace that it is a just war to bring a better tomorrow for everybody (in my country, we have rich experience with """"fighting for peace"""").
So, first of all, I don't think the speech was particularly paradoxical, let alone """"[[Orwellian]"""" - although I don't follow the US media; if MLPX can provide links of other commentators noting this, he has a case in point.
Secondly, even if the speech was meant to explicitly refer to FDR's Four Freedoms, I think that the mediated connection to 1984 is too loose and willed for an encyclopedia.
Thirdly and most importantly, even if the section had a place in the article, it's certainly not squat in the middle of the section """"The World of 1984"""". Move it down among late references, if it must be kept (and I agree with Alavery7 that it concerns more the speech than the novel so it should be better moved there).

Josif Stalin IS one of the three worst criminals in the history of mankind, the other two being Hitler and Mao. Mao killed 38 million human beings, Stalin at least 25 million and Hitler at least 20 million. The figures are there on the CIA website. It is unacceptable to show Stalin and Mao as politicians on Wikipedia website when Hitler is depicted as a monster. All of them were equally monsters and the personal cult communism was no differenct from nazism in essence.

You need to be aware that most former eastern bloc countries banned the use and display of the five-pointed red star and the hammer and sickle symbols of communism alongside the swastika and some local fascist sysmbols, because they know from personal experience that the horrors of stalinism were no less than that of nazism. The hungarian law banning all these is the XLV. (45th) law of 1993, titled """"Az önkényuralmi jelképek használatát tiltó törvény"""" and it has been upheld in constitutional court.

Stalin's crimes against Poland are amongst the most outrageous in written history. There is no excuse to the Molotov-Rippentropp pact. Make no mistake that was the Hitler-Stalin pact.

I really wish Stalin ruled you, not us. You are like Rumsfeld, who met Saddam during mid-1980s and praised him as a good ally in the anti-Khomeini Iran war. When will you realize that Putyin's current rule is an analog of Stalin's, characterized by extreme disregard for law, anti-semitism (most notably the early 50's doctor trials vs. 2004's Khodorkovski-Yukos) and imperialism (brutal military actions in the Caucasian Mountains both times and desire to the rule neighbours). Thus, by not mentioning Stalins criminality in unambigious terms, you hold the english-speaking world blind to Putyin's methods and you contribute to a """"new Uncle Joe"""" sentiment, which will inevitable put the world and the poor Russian race in great danger. A repetition of history for those who refuse to learn about the past.

Stalin started his reign with a few million dead, by reversing Lenin's post-civil-war """"new economic policy"""" of limited private agriculture thus leading to big famine.

The entire WWII in Europe would be over in 6-9 months had Stalin failed to entirely decapitate the soviet army's elite in 1937-39, this is clearly written in vol. 2. of soviet published seven-volume """"The history of the Great Patriotic War 1941-1945"""". You are plain stupid to praise Stalin for a """"hard earned victory in WWII"""".

So powerful was the fear of Stalin's evil power, that even us hungarians, who previously fought three revolutions and independence wars in the last 300 years, did not dare to raise again until autumn 1956 to free ourselves from stalinism. Anglo-saxons betrayed us big time then, shame on the Free World.

In churches renovated after WWII (big destruction in Hungary) the face of the Satan (as defeated by arch-angel Michael) is always of Josif Stalin's on wall paintings. People were shot for painting that.

Well that's driven me back to read the 1976 postscript - it's a good read - where the following apologia looks relevant

' ...' it is true that in 1955 I allowed some hectoring political moralisms, as well as a few Stalinist pieties, to intrude upon the text. I had then a somewhat reverent notion of Marxism as a received orthodoxy... The book was published at the height of the Cold War. Intellectual McCarthyism was not confined to the US...
The climate can be illustrated by the welcome afforded my book in the non-Socialist press. This welcome was mainly silence, broken by the review in TLS headed 'Morris & Marxism''

So, yes the _1955_ edition was coolly received, in EPT's opinion largely because of his unfashionable Marxist viewpoint. But in '76, (when The Making of the English Working Class was in its 5th Penguin reprint), things had moved on...   11:44, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)"

 Dividing vs gerrymandering 

Although """"gerrymandering"""" may seem like a politically loaded term that violates the NPOV principle, going by the current entry on Gerrymandering, it's appropriate and does not violate NPOV: in the case brought by Dems against the GOP to fight redistricting, the Dems argued the new district lines were drawn for racially motivated reasons. The GOP argued back that it was done strictly for political gain. This is the very essence of gerrymandering, and I suggest the word can be restored, and should be, because it is more descriptive.

Generally, I don't acknowledge the comments of someone who goes out of his/her way to talk down to me.  Suffice it to say that the burden of proof is on you and the Democrats to prove that the Grand Kleagle is NOT a racist pig of a Senator.  He was the one who choose to join the Klan, it was he that choose to recruit new members to the cross-burning organization.  It was NOT me that made him do those things.  It was him that wrote several articles defending the Klan after he supposedly left it.  It was him that as recently as 2001 was throwing around the n-word.  He is the racist, not me.  You have chosen to use your time and effort to defend the racist.  You need to look inside you for your personal motivation on why you feel that you must defend the racist.  The section of the article defending the Kleagle is indefensible.  Look at Trent Lott's bio.  There is no Republican writing an apology for Lott's comments.  Why do you feel the need to defend the Kleagle?  Oh, by the way, I can't believe that I even responded to you.  I only responded because you are fellow Jayhawk, but I normally would not respond to comments of your tone.  I will continue to remove and edit any untrue information that you place in an article also.  Only 13 Senators voted against Rice.  That is 13% of the Senators.

Not sure where to put this, so I'll put it here. Tomorrow I'll take a peek at places like the Village Pump, the Help Desk, or perhaps the editorial council page thingy that I saw somewhere and see if I should post my query there.

I've noticed that a subject I've done some contributing to is lacking its own article. Cable television red-links to digital telephone service. General Communications, Inc. red-links to digital cable telephony (I created that one).

If I were king of the world, I would create an article called digital telephony and make both of the above-mentioned red-links redirects to it. Or perhaps I would create a disambiguation page that links to digital cable telephony, digital fiber-optic telephony, VoIP and other similar articles (some of which don't exist yet.

Alas, I might be king of the world — or at least have editing power in the Wikipedia — but I don't have the time or knowledge to create an entire article about it. What should be done? Should I (or someone else) create a stub and redirect both?

I'm just afraid that someone will create an article under one entry but it won't be tied together with another entry, and there will forever be a dichotomy...or at worst parallel universes in which information is not shared between related subjects.

Are my fears unfounded? Should I just leave it be and let it evolve on its own?

 Some things to note about Stalin 

1., Many and most photos of Stalin are either heavily doctored or even fake. He was known to aviod photographers because his face was ugly from heavy pitting and canker. He had a number of better-looking doubles (stand-ins) to serve in PR opportunities. He used to stand on high/remote pedestrals when must appear in public to avoid close scrunity.

2., It is a commonly held opinion in Eastern Europe (I think it is a fact) that Josif Dsugasvili was an ordinary highwayman by profession before he joined the revolutionaries. He used to rob trains with a grops of outlaws, forcing people to stand and deliver.

3., Isn't it strange the Stalin Wikipedia article does not include the word dictator / dictatorship (or anything that starts with dict*) at all according to IE's search? Political correctness should not run amok, especially considering this is english language Wikipedia and US people know very little about foreign relations and history by school education, so it is easy to indoctrinate them by """"kind ol' Uncle Joe"""" babble. Or do you think only ancient roman leaders can be called a """"dictator"""" per definitionem? Most of Stalin's actions were clearly outside the realm of politics (which means debate and negotiations vs. headshot) so calling him a politician is an offense to leaders who spent their entire life serving their nation and all of its citizens in accordance with the people's will.

4., Did Stalin murder his wife? Has this issue been settled conclusively?

5., Hungarian people depicted while expressing their most sincere sentiments towards dead Stalin by toppling and decorating his giant statue in Budapest during the 1956 revolution:

Look at the Euro-X standard descriptions. Each one is just a single sentence and it tells us the truth frankly. Weight and numbers, nothing else matters. Acronyms are PR bullshit and do not belong to an ecyclopaedia.

Any person could create a system of circularly self-referencing acronyms and abbreviations for emissions categories out of thin air. Yet, it would still be zero information content. So either delete the US emissions section or add the numerical data (how many grams of CO2, NOx, SOx, unburnt fuel, particle charcoal matter are emitted per distance travelled) to back up those cryptic PZEV and alike codes with verifieable information.

Look at the Euro-X standard descriptions. Each one is just a single sentence and it tells us the truth frankly. Weight and numbers, nothing else matters. Acronyms are PR bullshit and do not belong to an ecyclopaedia.

It is a shame US people do not dare to face the polluting nature of their monster cars and try to hide the sad """"20mpg"""" reality behind cryptic PZEV and similar abbreviations. In Europe 65mpg is reality now.

Q3b7++QlMWVFFwl9t1jLRXsnsMk=," Hi.

 Re: ɰ
 /ɰ/ is equivalent to what some write as /w/ and orthographically as . This sound is not phonetically [w] because it does not have lip rounding, so some folks (including me) feel that <ɰ> is a more appropriate symbol.  was useful because it was found on typewriters while <ɰ> had to be written in by hand.  Computers are getting better at displaying this stuff, so I say use the more accurate symbol.
 [ç] is different in that there is audible frication and the constriction is further forward in the mouth. [ç] is an allophone of /h/, but [ɰ] is not.
 Actually, [ɰ] is redundant since it is just a short [ɯ] (like [j] is a short [i] and [w] is a short [u]) — we could just use a non-syllabic diacritic.

 Re: (j)
 (j) is supposed to mean /j/.  It doesnt include /ɰ/ — C+/ɰ/+V is not allowed. In other words, Japanese allows an optional /j/ before a vowel and following an optional consonant onset, i.e. V or /j/+V or C+V or C+/j/+V. -  09:52, 2005 Feb 7 (UTC)"

Kibo is the nickname, username and e-mail address (kibo@world.std.com or kibo@kibo.com) of James Parry (b. July 13 1967), a Usenetter known for his sense of humor, various surrealist net pranks, an absurdly long .signature, and an uncanny, machine-assisted knack for joining any thread in which his nom de guerre is mentioned (to """"kiboze""""). His exploits have gleaned him a multitude of enthusiasts, who celebrate him as the head deity of the joke pseudo-religion kibology, centered on the newsgroup alt.religion.kibology. 

James Parry grew up and lived in Schenectady, New York before moving to Boston, Massachusetts about 1990, where he lives today. He initially was a Computer Engineering major at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in Troy, NY, but when he moved to Boston attended Emerson College, where he studied videography and graphic design.  At that time, he also worked as a typeface designer and for the world.std.com internet service provider, whose praises he sings on his website (in a rare moment where he is not being outrageously tongue-in-cheek).  He has a great artistic eye for typeface and developed several fonts in use today.

Many assume his nickname is derived from the acronym KIBO, although Parry himself has repeatedly denied this.  Another rumor has it being short for King Body, a pseudonym he very briefly used on computer forums as a freshman at RPI in the mid-1980's.

Kibo is a supertaster, and has prosopagnosia.  He frequently dyes his hair, which as of late 2004 is bright orange.  Kibo likes bacon, but greatly dislikes cheese.

 VfD on Jews by country 

This has not yet been submitted, and John would wig out if I submitted it myself. But I suggest you discuss this with others ASAP. I submit for your discussion with others that the author has little regard for misrepresenting the reliability of his figures, that the article gives a inferior knowledge than the Jewish population article does both of current and pass population tends. That the title is questionable in its honesty because as he shows at the top of the discussion page, following his prevuious pattern he should have used the less offensive title Judaism by country. And finally, the figures which he has published do not come from the listed reference pages as he infers but have been generated by himself by multiplying the est. 2005 populations by the rough percentage numbers for the countries.

As an example, being Australian I checked his figure for """"Australian Jews"""" in his words. None of his references give his figure of 100,452. Nor do any of the reputable sources pretend to give percise religious numbers to six or eight digit accuracy. In fact, checking the references you quickly discover that the 2001 Australian census gave the figure of 84,000 people who marked Judaism as their religion. That all other real estimates are based upon adjustments to that figure, as is discussed on this page I found by a Christian Research Association. I finally did a Google searchon his claimed figure to discover that Wikipedia is the only publication claiming such a figure.

I couldn't resist the opportunity to indulge a little. ) Here's the dilly (or part of it) on dopamine, melanin and Parkinson's. Dopamine and melanin have very similar structures, and dopamine metabolism produces a form of melanin called """"neuromelanin,"""" which is different from eumelanin, pheomelanin, et cetera, but still certainly a melanin. Neuromelanin gradually accumulates in the neurons of the substantia nigra throughout a person's life. Kids have very little, elderly people have lots. When people get Parkinson's they start losing their neuromelanin, and their SN goes pale. The fairly recently-published histology and pathology books I'm using just take it for granted that the loss of neuromelanin is basically a side-effect of dopamine depletion. But I may have been a little too confident in assuming that that's the final word. I just checked the National Library of Medicine website and a bunch of new research is turning up more immediate connections between neuromelanin and Parkinson's than had been suspected. Also, it looks like they're also getting promising results in studies on therapies that involve endocrine manipulation of neuromelanin. Still, all of this specifically involves neuromelanin in the dopaminergic neurons of the SN, and I haven't personally learned, heard or run across anything stating that there is any connection whatsoever between skin melanin and Parkinson's. But I guess the take home message for me is that there is more going on here than I realized, so I can't write off the possibility that there is alsothough I can't imagine howsome emerging connection between neuromelanin/Parkinson's and a person's skin melanin levels. Anyway, as you say, this article is about melanin generally, not just skin melanin in humans, so regardless the Parkinson's link is legit.  19:57, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

jU9N9Rg6Jc+XCoN9CtB/F/0dVUI=,"""== Literal text ==
I have changed """"According to the literal text of the constitution, the Governor-General is the representative of the Queen of Australia."""" to refer to Queen Victoria instead. I did this to make a point and that point is that the literal text of the Constitution cannot be taken as an unfailingly reliable guide to either practice or law.

Read the Constitution and you will find no mention of the Prime Minister, who is undeniably the head of government, even if one might imagine that this position is occupied by the Governor-General from a cursory reading of the Constitution. The Constitution declares that there shall be an Inter-State Commission, but the truth is that this body does not exist.

Please, if you refer to the literal text of the Constitution, either stick to the literal text and refrain from inserting material that does not belong - you will search in vain for the title """"Queen of Australia"""", for example - or qualify it by referring to documents and events such as the Royal Style and Titles Act 1953 where the title """"Queen of Australia"""" was introduced.  23:44, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Skyring - It is interesting how your own comments can be used to demonstrate how you add your own point of view - """"I did this to make a point!"""". A point about """"literal"""" text is make by using the adjective """"literal"""". Your point belongs elsewhere.

Anyway, the literal text does not mention """"Queen Victoria"""" it mentions the """"Queen"""". It further states that the """"Name of the King or Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the time being is to be substituted from time to time"""". This is what I has done. Maybe, there is a more accurate way of making this subtitution, but """"Queen Victoria""""! That's wrong, wrong, wrong!

Is it? Have you checked the original? I think that you will find that instead of checking, you jumped in with some more untruths. Please think instead of responding when I press your buttons.  21:50, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I notice you haven't responded to this. Have you checked the original? This is in Parliament House, and is on public didplay.  00:04, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Yes I have checked: www.foundingdocs.gov.au

""""Not found The page you requested is not available at this address."""" I suggest you check the original. I have.  00:29, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Rather than just jump in and make changes after 15 seconds thought, go back have a think for serveral days before you start adding stuff like this!. It just wastes time. Also, when you say """"Please!"""", """"Read the constitution"""", you are showing contempt for others. 
 01:02, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

When someone makes an obvious mistake like saying the literal text of the Constitution refers to the Queen of Australia, then I am quite justified in asking that person to read it.  21:50, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

If you refer to the """"literal text"""" of the Constitution you will have to concede that it contains no reference to a """"Queen of Australia,"""" and that is because the thought of Australia as a state separate from the British Empire would have been quite foreign to the men who wrote the Constitution.  01:56, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I explained the substitution logic above and applied it. Then skyring put in """"Queen Victoria"""" !!! So I reduced it to just just """"Queen"""" (ie no substiution.) I have no problem either way.  11:56, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Let's stick with the Queen, shall we? That's probably the best bet.  21:50, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I thought the point about literal text had been made, but I see that it has not been appreciated. The Constitution does not state that the Governor-General is the representative of the Queen. If you want to quote the literal text of the Constition, then by all means do so, but don't go making stuff up that you think might or should or could be in there, when it clearly isn't.  23:49, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Nowhere in the literal text of the Constitution will you find the statement """"the Governor-General is the representative of the Queen"""". Nowhere. s2 states """"A Governor-General appointed by the Queen shall be Her Majesty's representative"""". That is a clear statement of intention. I noted s101 previously, which states: """"There shall be an Inter-State Commission"""". There is not an Inter-State Commission, so clearly it is incorrect to say that the literal text of s2 means that the Governor-General is now the Queen's representative, given the example"

Dear Wikipedia """"""""Neutrality"""""""" guardian, 
Re Saddam Hussein entry,
no one has yet to answer my question, why do the live palestinians deserve mention in the 
primary intro for a non palestinian leader, but the Slaughtered Kurds of Saddam's own countrymen do not? 

You could have Written """"Some parts of the Arab world admired Saddam for standing up to the west"""". Without mentioning the Palestinians, just like you refuse to mention the slaughtered 
Kurds. But you insist on mentioning the Palestinians, and further conceal any remnant of opposing POV with the fascist's friend, the term  """"human-rights situation"""" which you hope anyone can interpret as anything. 
Are you claiming that the horrors both existed and didn't exist, depending on who you ask? where are all those dead kurds, then?

revive them! I'm sure they will be glad to read in wikipedia that what was done to them was only """"a situation"""". A situation is good. Elain in Seinfeld has situations. comes and goes. They can dig up their graves and go home to watch the reruns.

Never mind the bodies, they will soon rot and everyone would have forgotten all about it. Shhhhhhh. But Only one thing as sure as the Sun existed, didn't it? The palestinians and their glee! thats as solid as Iron! who needs proof? its the Palestinians! Amen!
Do you have a paraplegic handy by any chance?
 
I want to know a rational arumgent of why it is so important and humanitarian to 
disguise Saddams undisputed, DNA proven horrors. It must be VERY important. there must
be some divine logic here beyond my rationality.
Oh, It will upset the palestinians? sure! don't you think Saddam's other little hobbies (other than encouraging palestinians) have upset at least the same number of people or largeer? why do you stifle their emphasis then?
Either you stifle ALL non Iraqi effects of Saddam, or you mention them NEUTRALLY
that means not ONLY the palestinians!
 
Are you perhaps saying that 10,000 gassed kurds and their millions of grieving relatives/supporters are less important than 2 million live palestinians with no direct contact to Iraqi affairs other than a blushing glee at Saddam's deeds?
if so, how many? how many non-palestinians does it take to die till that issue becomes 
important enough to mention if it contrasts the palestinian POV?  a million? 6 million by any chance? does this number mean anything to you or do you just file it in you head as
""""Human rights situation""""? 

and how many palestinians angry that 1+1=2 would it take for you to remove all the
henceforth controversial entries on mathematics? 3 palestinians? 4 perhaps?
remember how to count women They won't like it unless you count women as 1:2 for men.
they might cause something to your """"Human rights situation"""" otherwise. 

And this pargraph:

an increase in human-rights abuses, notably acts of genocide against Iraqi Kurds. The United States continued to view Saddam with deep suspicion, however, primarly due to his pursuit of weapons of mass destruction

do you have any factual references that dispute any of this? supported FACTS not 'liberal' wishful illusions!   all of it is corroborated in the links!

And this,

""""Thanks for pointing this out. I suspect that it was removed because an anon is getting a kick out replacing non-controversial matter-of-fact statements like the above with overtly emotive, deliberately provocative ones.""""

Are you hinting that this sentence:
""""While he remained a popular hero among many disaffected Arabs for standing up to the West and for his unflinching support for the Palestinians""""

is a NPOV? what proof do you have of his support of the palestinians? are ther
any references of this, or just hearsay?

Just call wikipedia the Western Edition of Pravda, and be done with it!
(never mind that the Palestinian POV is merely matter of morale, and the opposing POV rests on actual crimes of war! how in your humane conscience can you condone this state of affairs?)
And I dont wan't to skewer anyone either. If I wante to Skewer Saddam, I would have called him a Hitler wannabe; Little Stalin,  the prince of evil and so forth. This is skewering.
Mentioning FACTS is never skewering, even if the palestinians don't like them!

Whether there were earlier theories I don't know. In other places where atronomy was independently invented (India, China etc.) its probably fair to assume that the idea of aliens must have arisen.

NPOV concerns

I tend to agree with the NPOV concerns of some comments here.  They seem to be more along the lines of what is *not* included than what is.  To be fair, a google search returned far more of the 'critical' sources than any other.

However, I was able to make a minor edit I regard as an improvement. I replaced one Guardian article, """"Iran contra men return to power"""" with another from the same publication, the """"Negroponte: Amercia's voice of experience"""" article.

I believe the former article is redundant to many of the others, and as the least specific to Mr. Negroponte is the least relevent.  The latter article I believe balances the collective tone of the references, and does not omit mention of the Honduras accusations.

The reason being, that there was only one emperor during those times(in the West) and only after Protestantism did multiple emperors become a feature of Western Europe.  Was the King of England a Sovereign during the time predating the Anglican schism, or was he subordinate to the Holy Roman Emperor?  I postulate this, due to the fact that the Cardinals and Archbishops were subordinate to the Pope and figured that there's some part of history not being told to enough children.  Wouldn't that be a reason to break with the Vatican back then?  Once Henry broke with the Church, he was able to incorporate Wales and the Royal House changed from province to surname.  I was thinking that the provincial royal house like Anjou, Blois or Normandy is a Continental style.  Once England broke away, they went to personal names like Tudor and Stuart...even though Henry was technically of the House of Richmond.  Once England had become the center of another empire, just of its own, they reverted to usage of provincial houses.  So, what do you think...Am I right?"

Guys, after reading this tedious list of conversation, my sugguestion of the best way out of the naming convention of China is using those by native speakers of Chinese. As a native speaker of several dialects of Chinese, I make the following table which should help: 

How native Chinese speakers refer to:
Speakers from
Mainland China
Taiwan
HongKong
Macau

Referring to China (Mainland)
China
Mainland (daliu)
Mainland or Zhongguo Daliu (chong-gua-da-lok in Cantonese)
Mainland

Taiwan
Taiwan or Taiwan Province (the more official tone)
Taiwan
Taiwan
Taiwan

China (the culture etc., non-political issue
China
China
China
China

Most Chinese, regardless of where they are from, care less about the naming convention but some Taiwanese (like my buddy who is gonna marry next month) DO NOT WANT Mainland China to annex Taiwan and had bad impression on Chen Shuibian.

KT2

 Knowing what the Chinese call it is certainly interesting, but what is important is what the English-language people call it. 

I'm with Jeronimo. I also thought all of this already had been resolved  China should be the main article of the PRoC. It doesn't matter what they officially call it or want it to be called. English speakers call it China in overwhelming numbers. This is also the conventional short form used by the CIA and the UN and we have decided that that is what we will use for country names here. If we don't stick to that then we are expressly taking sides in political naming issues. The fact that the PRoC is currently trying to dissociate their government from """"China"""" (which seems counter intuitive for a totalitarian regime..) is an interesting thing to mention in the article on the PRoC at China. If we change the name of the article to follow political correctness of the PRoC that is an express act of support for their policy. I for one say we defer such naming matters to higher authorities such as the CIA Factbook, the UN and especially what is most commonly used by English speakers. True they are POV institutions but transcribing what they use is a passive and not express act of POV. Wikipedia is not in the business to decide what the names of nations are  other institutions are far better suited at this highly charged topic. I also think the disclaimer is way too long and bold should be replaced by italics. Any article on the PRoC sho"

 Ward Churchill is Not An Indian 
I am an enrolled member of Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma and I used to work for the BIA. I added into the article the written opinions of people that have researched Churchill's Indian ancestry and 99% of these Indian folks point out that Churchill has not provided the basic information required to prove that he is an Indian. I put it up last night and it much of it was taken down early this morning. It was information where I provided sources for the comments. I understand that what I wrote can and should be edited. But taking out information that provides sources and citations seems to be an attempt to stifle the information. Dear Fred Bauder, it IS fair to ask if Churchill really is an Indian. He is taking away from actual Indian people the ability to speak for themselves. He has build his whole career on being someone who has experienced the oppression of a minority culture. It is similar to a white middle class Protestant person from Idaho was writing books about himself being a Jew in Hitler's Germany. And don't even say that I just made a inaccurate analogy because Churchill himself compares and uses Hitler and Nazi analogies. I'm sure that is how you learned about him in the first place because he made this most recent comment about 9/11 victims are all """"Eichmann's."""" Look, providing information about whether you are an Indian or not should not be that difficult. Why? You have Indian parents. It is simple as that. Even if you don't have brothers and sisters then you have Indian parents and your parents have brothers and sisters. Correct? Why doesn't anyone in Indian Country know any of these people? This is NOT a cheap shot as you indicated above. It goes to the heart of who he claims that he is. As Suzan Harjo pointed out: Churchill is taking jobs and speaking engagements from real actual Indians and building a whole career on it. Those jobs and speaking engagements should go to actual Indian. Also, Harjo made the point that Churchill's comments are having a backlash and where is that backlash going? On to Indian Country. Look, no one believes that he should not have the right to say what he wants. We all believe in the First Amendment even if it is difficult speech. However, just don't run around and claim that you are an Indian when you aren't and that you personally have been oppressed. Let's say that I am a white person that lives in Kentucky and I attend a Baptist church and my parents came the United States from South Africa, do you really believe that I could run around and write books on Irish experience of oppression in Belfast? No. But that is what he is doing. And you are calling it a cheap shot. It is not a cheap shot. It goes to who and what he is. He is what we call in Indian Country a Wannabee. There is a whole tribe of Indians called the Wannabee Indians and he is the Chief. The people that making the complaints about his fake Indian heritage are not conservatives by any stretch of the imagination either: Suzan Harjo (worked for Bill Clinton), Dennis Banks (Founder of the American Indian Movement), etc. He can say wherever he wants about 9/11 or America, but he shouldn't lie and claim that he is an Indian when he isn't. And schools like the Univ of Colorado should do a better job of doing there homework when they hire a someone and put out to the world that he is an Indian because he isn't.Keetoowah 17:45, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)"""

AIvfIr0mheoCj+XCwdqVl/Hf/w0=," Some personal observations here: 
Put a summary of it into the Roots of Christianity; perhaps a whole subsection thereof.  If the Zoroastrianism part is included, then so must the Egyptian especially since the Hebrews were long associated with Egypt back to the Hyksos invasion.  It would be POV to disclude this factor, considering the trail of monotheism left by Akhenaten and adopted by the Hebrews.  I myself don't know much about Zoroaster, but I certainly recognise much of the Egyptian issue and I'm more of a casual researcher.  It seems to me that Zoroastrian elements are tied to the Persian background, but it would be prejudiced to say that the Egyptians have no basis when they long dominated Palestine.  The Greek Pharaoh himself patroned the Septuagint in Alexandria.  I find the bigotry towards an Egyptian root of Christianity to be entirely unfounded when so much of Egyptian culture was adopted by all peoples in a certain radius outwards.  Perhaps this lies in traditional ideas about race; that the Hamites of Africa have not contributed anything and that the Persians supposedly were/are White or considered Japhethic as opposed to the Semites.  Seriously, this Noahidic classification thing is ridiculous because these Afro-Asiatic people are undoubtedly very much alike and most uninvolved observers would say they are less White than the Greeks and Romans.  I consider Persians to be Semites because they are Asian, in this context.  Give it as much credence as the Persian foundations and you will make this NPOV.  I seriously suggest expounding upon both roots of Christianity and also delineating the Greek root which provided Roman impetus for adoption and proliferation.  For instance, if the Greeks hadn't patroned that religious culture as their relation to Philistines, Rome would have dismissed it as everything else in their cultural relationship with Greece.  Rome even rebuilt Greek Philistia as Palestine and during the Catholic Crusades, it became the Kingdom of Jerusalem.  Christianity has so many dimensions, that it would be haughty to overlook its far ranging origins which even has pagan influences from Europe and Buddhist ties in Southwest Asia.  

I myself used to be atheist or Odinist not wanting to deal with what I percieved to be other peoples' culture and now I look in wonder at the historical background of the Sea Peoples and the subsequent Graeco-Roman expansion in the Mediterranean Sea.  There are European roots throughout the region now considered Islamic or Arab, but if we don't provide the means for people to see it we will forget it as much as the terrible destruction of the Library of Alexandria.  Just think of the term Indo-European and you will understand Alexander the Great's empire.  See the connection between the European fylfot and Indian swastika or the Cross and the Ankh?  Please don't demolish this magnificent research, for it has been a great boon in my life to know these things.  I am only stating things as I commonly have studied and heard of them.  I do not propose to limit and debar other positions on this issue, therefore I am not endorsing POV.  The various sources I have seen via Google search appear legitimate and/or sometimes biased(as anything!), but it is not my position to judge the appropriateness of the topic.  We are not to cast a POV on the issue in favour or against, just to deliver as any messenger does.  The existing article on the History of Christianity provides the Persian background but does not give adequate coverage of the Egyptian or Hellenic origins, which are quite prominent.  After all, Christianity had most of its evolution in non-Persian areas of the Mediterranean Sea.  Tell me, how many Persian people are prominent in the Christian world throughout its history?  What fractionary comparison can you draw that factually examines the amount and shows a majority of Persian elements in Christianity, compared to the vast amount of Greek specialty(as written, verified and generally known amongst the entire Christian populace) and the nursery of Christianity itself in Egypt via the Old Testament(even Jesus's infancy was spent in Egypt, in safety from Herod!)?  Please, where is the background of Christianity in Persia besides 19th century racial studies?  Like I've said, the Noahide classification thing has been similarly discredited and its density in weight grew most during that era for Indo-Aryan racist theories.   23:43, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)"

 Pathetic Motorways, and the """"Walton Summit Motorway"""" 

I resent the implication, being the webmaster of the aforementioned site.  The site is not a """"Wacky Website"""", but a factually accurate record, with comments tossed in.  You are allowed to educate without boring people, you know!

UncleG is proceeding from a false assumption:  that the classification of all motorways is listed on signposts.  There are many other examples of """"unsigned"""" motorways where official DfT documentation exists, such as the tiny A635(M) in Manchester or the A14(M) in Cambridgeshire.

The Walton Summit Motorway is an extremely unusual case.  Whilst it is quite true that there are many short motorway spurs that are simply a part of the """"parent"""" motorway, such as the M1 spur at Luton, the Walton Summit Motorway does not fall into this category.

As is clearly pointed out, the Walton Summit Motorway is neither part of the M61, nor part of the M65, but does have motorway classification because it inescapably leads to the roundabout that links the two.  There is no other stretch of motorway in the UK where a short """"spur"""" motorway actually links two different motorways.

If it is part of the M65, as the """"start of restrictions"""" sign at the bottom of the hill implies, then why does the directional flag sign state """"M61 (M65)"""", meaning a part of the M61?  This is a common form of signage throughout the UK system, but is unusual to be found upon a motorway.  

A similar item can be seen with reference to the example of the A635(M) above, the """"start of restrictions"""" sign when heading westbound on the A635(M) clearly states """"A57(M)"""", but the DfT documentation states otherwise. (it's the """"Statutory Instrument 1995 No. 3266 The City of Manchester (Mancunian Way A635(M) and A57(M) Mancunian Way Slip Roads) Special Road Scheme 1992 Confirmation Instrument 1995"""" that you're looking for if you're really concerned about its accuracy.  A PDF copy is available on Pathetic Motorways, but a simple Google search will turn up the relevant central government pages if you doubt the source material).

The Walton Summit Motorway is a motorway without a number, hardly an unusual concept in road terms, where most roads either do not possess a classification number, or is of a """"C"""", """"D"""" or """"U"""" classification, which do not appear on road signs.  It is, bowever, an unusual concept in motorway terms."""

MArtha Hildebrant, President of the Congress and member of Peru 2000, Fujimori´s political Party. It was widely know that they would try to impeach Fujimori from Office. They did it 2 times, and in the last vote (wich was extremely controvertial) they succeded.

- 16 de septiembre: Fujimori llama a nuevas elecciones generales y dice que no participará. (Reuters y Dpa). Fujimori WAS PRESENT in Peru after the Vladi-video. 

- Peruvian Congressman Javier Diez Canseco is one of the most untrusted members of this failed parlament. If you didn't know, he was an active member of the EXTREME Left during the times of the Civil War here in Peru. He was involve in several scandals during the 80's for his open suport to Sendero Luminoso. He was in China (representing Peru in that Communist country) at the time of the self-coup, and he lost his seat in the chamber of deputies after that. It is not surpricely that he had exagerated much of the information that he use and his open hate towards the former President is widely know. Besides that, Public enterprises here in Peru where already collapsing becouse of the saturisation of APRA Party Members in those institutions.

- Peru is in resecion for other motives. Since when international financial crisis does not affect some countries? you are ignoring the fact that during 1997 there was also a mayor political crisis her due to the hostages in the Japanese emmbassy. 

- The Constitution of 1993 IS NOT retroactive. Fujimori was elected with the 1979 constitution. According to some lawyers, this make him possible to run for a 2th term under that constitution. (he was democraticaly eleccted in 1995 with the 1993 constitution.) It was controvertial, it's true. But most of the power struggle here was caused by the fact that the most important (before the 90's) political parties in Peru were already tired of being ignored by the electorated.

- If you are trying to sell me the idea that the poor terrorist were slaughter with no feeling by the Army, you are completely wrong. May I remind you that it was a war zone? that the poor terrorist where armed with ak-74 and that they have and RPG inside the embassy? Oh, of course that Aministia international will defend them to death, since is their job to do that. I agree with Colombian President Alvaro Uribe when he said that they only care about terrorist and not their victims. once again, this is a patetic effort by yours to rewrite history.

- That order was removed several days latter due to the fact that it created a political storm here, becouse Fomer President Alan Garcia is also accused with the same and is free walking around Lima. Due to political Pressure by the APRA, it was removed, and if you know, that minister was already fire from his post.

Please, read carefully and don't go around trying to rewrite history. We don't forgot ours, but it is sad to see how missinformed can be the world about what really happened here. OH, and by the way, Please, before reverting something please stated why are you reverting it.   15:19, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)"

Calm down, don't exert pressure when you can talk in normal tone.  Anyhow, I did provide evidence, but I guess your idea of evidence is a photograph or a video tape showing Shahrbanoo being dragged on sand by the Arabs.  So Ali knew Persian, eh?  I suppose you have evidence for this?  The page you asked me to click says Ali knew persian and furthermore it quotes a Shia hadith which claims the following masterpiece of comedy:
Ali, then came up to the princess and asked: """"What is your name?"""" The princess replied: """"The daughter of Jahan-shah"""". Ali said: """"and so Shahr-banuyeh you will be called"""" (""""the bride of the land"""").

Do you honestly believe that?!  That claim is embarrassingly stupid.  So what evidence you have that Ali knew Persian?  And what evidence you have that Shahrbanoo, who was clearly captured by the Arabs, married Hussayn willingly? Oh, and for your good information, there is plenty of solid historical evidence that her name was Shahrbanoo, and the Arabs didn't gave her that name.  Even if and Arab knew some Persian, what are the chances they knew the difference between the double meaning of """"land/country and city"""" for """"shahr""""?  At any rate, the Zoroastrians also call her Shahrbanoo, and if her name was given by Ali to her, the Zoros would have referred to her by her original name not by her allegedly Arab given name. Besides, didn't it occur to your brilliant mind that  if Ali was going to give her a name, he would have given her an Islamic name not  a Persian name?   06:52, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)"""

If you really beleive all that Shia crap, then good luck to you, cuz you're gonna need it in life.  You don't seem to have a solid grip on reality.  You seem to live in your own world. Anyhow, I will give you a bit of clue free of charge.  The reason there are some favourable Hadiths for Iranians is, surprise surprise, because out of the 6 main Hadith authors, 4 were Iranians, including the 3 most authoritative ones:  Bukhari, Termezi and Hajjaj.  Nasai was also Iranian.  The first 3 were Khurasani, and Nasai was from Pars.  The other 2 Hadith authors are not as major and their works are basically a copy-and-paste from the Hadith of the Iranian authors.  Hajjaj was from Neyshapour but claimed to be of Qushayri origin, so that he was better accepted as some """"real Arab"""" from an authentic Arabic origin, but there is academic information that he was indeed of Khorasani origin, and his claim of """"al-Qushayri"""" roots is unverifiable.

Many people who say they are against 'trolling' are actually, when you talk to them about it, against vandalism, personal attacks or timewasting, none of which I condone. I think that w e need to be more tollerant of different approaches as a community, and more willing to try to understand each other - in that way we can build the best encyclopedia possible.

Squeakbox's allegations about Nazism and editing a Rastafarian page (to the best of my recollection I have never been to such a page  my knowledge about Squeakbox's Rastafarian sympathies came from his own Wikipedia page)are nothing short of libelous and outrageous.  Obviously he has never read my work.  Most likely he is unfamiliar with the extremely readable and scholarly books of James Webb on occultism, including Nazi permutations of same.  Nazism was clearly based on occultism  evident in every respect from the Thule Society and Theosophical Society roots to the swastika itself.  Hitler did not take his notions from a vaccuum  his notions of """"cleansing actions"""", """"master races"""" and """"aryanism"""" were standard fare in all occult reading  both of Rosicrucians and Theosophists.  As far as left hand swastikas and right hand swastikas are concerned, there are ample books (many of which are in my personal library) showing that it was used interchangeably both ways in both occult and Indian cultures.  The Jews were singled out for hatred in most such literature and still are in the books published by Lucis Trust / Lucis Publishing Company.  Just look at the indexes (and you can do free internet searches):  """"Judaism:  evils of""""; """"Judaism, need for dissolution of"""".  I have BATTLED Nazism and racism all of my life, starting at age 4 when I told an aunt, """"that man's not bad because he wants to move in your neighborhood.  You're bad because you want to move out just because he's moving in . . .""""  Squeakbox owes me an apology.  He confesses he flunked logic.  He also confesses to a closed head injury with a machete type instrument.  For that, I will give him in good Christian style, a charitable interpretation and hope to think that these are his honest interpretations.  Read the New Age books CAREFULLY and not in an altered state  you will find that they are not all peace, light love.  And people who come against them are not """"Nazis""""  the kernel of Nazism is the occultism which in its essence spells doom to all who are not blonde, blue-eyed pagans in its ultimate world view.  I have many a New Age book from the early 1980s in my vast personal collection which tells Orientals, Africans, etc., that they should be practicing celibacy as their races are destined to die out anyway.

 Jesus, pre-4th century Christianity, and syncretism 

I have added a comment on the VfD page. See Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Jesus, pre-4th century Christianity, and syncretism#Discussion about the merge. If I could find out which bits to merge, I'd be very grateful for feedback! -  11:56, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)

 That was a pretty horrible thing you said you know. 

Did you actually bother to investigate CheeseDreams? did you check her ArbCom cases? Did you check how she deliberately and spitefully vandalised my user page? Did you bother to read any of the things I wrote? Where do you get off saying I enjoyed having CheeseDreams banned? I didn't do that: CD did that via her editing practices and disruption of Wikipedia. -  15:19, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Say what?! Look mate, I'm disputing the article, not CheeseDreams. The article is an essay written from an assumption (and in fact pretty much stated as """"fact"""") that Jesus was the """"new sycretism"""". This is, to put it frankly, quite far from the truth and though the info should be stated that such and such stated such and such, there should not be an entire article, especially one like CheeseDreams created. Why do you think I'm not opposing that a merge be done? Sheesh. You'd think I'm trying to destroy CheeseDreams life works or something. -  15:47, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I would NPOV the article if I could. I can't. Why? Because the material isn't reference properly. Incidently, don't hold your breath for CheeseDreams to come back. She posted her password to a known trolls page and forced another admin to log in to her account quickly and change the password. She no longer has access to her account! In fact, we found 5 verified sock puppets of CheeseDreams (all with the same password) and she no longer has access to these accounts. You might want to note that I did start adding material: I have created an article The Two Babylons, which I encourage you to help me make more complete (I've only done the first two sections - and not even that). In the process I edited the article to clear up some misconceptions of CheeseDreams (like for instance she called Alexander Hislop a """"scholar"""", which he most certainly wasn't). 
However, I'm not sure how much time I have for you. I'm a little confused personally. The other day I was accused by a Stormfront member of being a traitor to the white race and/or a Jew, however today you tell me I'm a Nazi. Would you people please make up your minds? I'm getting mighty confused. -  17:20, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)

and then in Gen 2:7:

 """"then the Lord God formed the man of dust from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living creature,"""" 

followed by Gen 2:21:

 """"So the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and while he slept took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh. And the rib that the Lord God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man.""""

These passages contradict one another.  The first states man and woman being created together.  The second two have Adam being created first, followed by Eve.  If a person believes that the Bible is the word of God then both are correct.  So, to make them both correct there has to be a first woman followed by Eve.  Which is how the idea of Lilith came about - filling in the gaps to make both versions true.  If a person believes the Bible is the inspired word of God, written by men capable of error, there is no need for Lilith.

 More on changes made to """"Early Soviet Rule and World War II section"""" 

I will not respond to the personal attack directed at """"the person who simply reverted this passage..."""". As for the substance of the issue:

1. Reasons of Capital move to Kharkov. ProhibitOnions introduced to the article an idea that one of the reasons of the capital move was the fact Kharkov's was more dominated by ethnic Russians than Kiev. This claim has some logic in the context of the events, but I have not seen this claim made in any serious source. If this is due to my ignorance, I suggest ProhibitOnions provides at least some references, or, if he can't find them off hand, at least gives some hints where he saw this info, so that it can be checked. His statement on the talk page that """"many historians concede"""" on this is too vague of a reference. If this is indeed his own speculation based on his interpretation of the logic of events, this qualifies as original research, whose place is current scholary or popular publications, personal web-sites, etc., but not an encyclopedia, which should reflect an established knowledge.

2. Possible role of famine in the capital return to Kiev.  PO agrees, that the discussion of the issue belongs to other articles but thinks, it is also relevant here. My point is that this info is factually accurate, but its relevance is too remote. Deliberate killing milions of people was a horrible crime, but Kiev itself, unlike the vast regions of Ukrainian countryside, was not ravaged by famine. Should the info on the deliberate famine caused by the actions of the Bolshevik government be introduced into every article related to any Ukrainian topic? If PO helps me understand why famine should be in Kiev article, I am open to ideas. 

3. Finally, PO removed from the article the statement that Kiev growth was mostly caused by migration from other parts of Ukraine which indeed re-established Ukrainian spirit in the city, which is confirmed, for example, by a relative rise of Ukrainian theater and literature in Kiev at the time. He substituted it by the statement about """"the migration from other parts of the Soviet Union."""" Where does he get this info?

The changes he introduced seem ideological rather that relevant and I reverted them once. Now, I laid out my reasons and will wait for some days for comments rather than reverting this changes right now. Please, no flames.  19:00, Mar 15, 2005 (UTC)"""

Republics
Need your help and/or advice.  The British Wikipedian Republican Party sought fit to delete Wikinfo:Classical definition of republic from Wikipedia.  There is a terrible brouhaha at Talk:Republic. They won't even allow an external link! SimonP really doesn't know what he is doing.  They deleted the Classical definition of republic and created mixed government and politeia instead.  The official title of mixed government is a Republic and the Romans translated """"politiea"""" as Republic.  And then to top it off the new article Classical republicanism doesn't refer to the Classical republics of Crete, Sparta, Solonic Athens, or Rome but to Machiavelli's ideology.  How can that be when Venice in the 13th century instituted a mixed government and called herself a """"Republic"""".  

With Jwrosenwieg and Kim Bruning there was a tacit agreement a year ago to have republic be the modern meaning and a [Classical definition of republic] to describe the ancient republics of Hellas and Rome and their influence.  To say the least the """"Republic section"""" is all messed up. We need some clarification.  I have new information but User:Snowspinner won't let me bring this back up for undelete. (I do grant that a little bit of the Classical definition is original but the rest is not.) I will not let Sparta be called anything but a republic!  I will not let the British wikipedian modern republicans strip Sparta, (my heritage and roots) of her rightful name.  She is a Classical republic and needs to be called such!  At the least, where is the damage in having an external link?

 Kosebamse's anti-Cubic crusade

Secondly, you demand testable predictions. I will firstly point out that most theories have values other than the capacity to predict the outcome of experiments. Had relativity been formulated only after all its implications had been verified, it would still be used widely, but for such practical uses as technology development and simulation. As such, to determine a theory's practical value, we must focus on its real-life ramifications  testable hypotheses, but not necessarily predictions.

From the fundamental Cubic principles, we may broadly define manifestations of Cubic geometry evident in reality. Firstly, that everything is cyclical. In the case of large-scale phenomena, such as cyclicality of galaxy death and rebirth, and that of the universe as a whole, our observational capabilities may not suffice; but on smaller scales, cyclicality certainly is measurable.

A second observable influence is the life that has evolved on Earth, representing an interaction between chaos and Time Cube. Cubic properties are evident in lifeforms  see and Pyramidal Lifeforms, and Systems and Complexities in Nature."""

if  changed (let's say got bigger), conceptually, that would have meaning, the electromagnetic force (relative to the other fundamental interactions) would have changed in proportion (gotten a little bigger).  then it would appear that the charge of an electron has gotten a little bigger (but it might not have) or that Planck's constant has gotten a little smaller (but it might not have) or that the speed of light has gotten a little smaller (that's the choice you and authors such as Moffat made) or even (if we're gonna say that  might have changed) that the permittivity of free space has changed (like ,  is defined in many measurement systems, such as SI or cgs).  (i doubt anyone will argue that it's  or  that has changed.)  heck, someday soon (i would expect within a decade)  will be defined (because of a redefinition of the kilogram).  if they do that, then a change in  gets blamed on a change of , which still seems most natural to me, but that's my opinion.  even so,. if they did that to  and  was measured to have changed, i would not argue that all of the electrons and protons and positrons in the universe have somehow transferred charge.  i would say that they appear to have a different charge since their strength of their interaction has changed (which is fundamentally all a change in  can mean).  that is all we would know or could ever know.  to blame any conceptual change of  on a change of any of the dimensionful ingredients to it, is silly.  16:04, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)"

As discussed, the continuum does involve aerobic muscle fibers even in primarily anaerobic activities. They simply don't contribute much to the overall effort. Again see the chart here. The aerobic component is well less than 5% for activities well past the low rep high weight range. Even if it were 20% aerobic component, that would still qualify as primarily anaerobic.

 NPOV again 

First of all, I'm Brazilian and PRO Lula. I want a more neutral article. Not all the people in Brazil, I know, like him. But not all the people hate him. Every one knows what NPOV means, it would be rather a Multiple Point of view. So, criticism and good things must come together. Althou, Wikipedia cannot agree with bias, hate or fanatism.
Here is a list of some alterations I made and a bit of opinion:

 Biography: it is alright. It is a standart biography...
 Elections... """"In the second round of the 2002 election, (...) and became the president of Brazil."""" instead of """"to become the president-elect of Brazil"""". Just a bit of grammar.3
 The Government - Political Orientation: some time before, I transfered a piece of text about the radical-left-wing of PT from this article to PT's article. I DID NOT DELETED it. I just put it in a better place, because it is not a personal problem of Lula, but a problem for the party. Every one agree? The external links about it i tranfered to PT's article, too.
 The Government - Reforms and Important Laws. When I first wrote it I put each item as a section (I was pretending to write a piece of text for each one). It was oversized and so, following a sugestion, I changed it in a list. All right?
 Deleted: """"Unfortunately, there has been no control over the program on behalf of the government and """"Bolsa Família"""" has been transformed into mere populism."""" - It is not the common sense. It is a political point of view of an action of the government. Populism is a dangerous word that must be avoided. Maybe we could use another phrase instead, like it: """"Althou, there is some criticism on the efficency of this project."""".

Thank you, """

The problem with titling a geographic article based on """"who should control the area"""" rather than """"who does control the area"""" is that it leads to endless arguments over who has the better claim.  Using """"who does control the area"""" makes people unhappy, but at least it's easy to determine.

As a case in point: the city of Jerusalem.  Who """"should"""" control and name it?  The current Israeli nation?  The Palestinians?  The British?  they conquered it in 1917.  Or should it be Turkey, the successor to the Ottoman Empire, who controlled it prior to that?  Egypt, who controlled it in the 13th century?  Germany? Fredrick II held it during the Crusades.  The Vatican, as spiritual successor to the Crusaders?  Italy, as successors to Rome?  Any surviving descendants of the Jebusites, who the Israelites displaced in antiquity?

 Wikipedia """"Patricia Cornwell"""" page libelous, being used for felony fraud crimes 

The main Wikipedia """"Patricia Cornwell"""" page is not only libelous, defamatory, false and misleading, but it is also being used to support felony crimes of fraud and extortion. The page itself is a felony criminal act of obstruction of justice, because it uses the Wikipedia public forum to give a false report of previously committed crimes. Wikipedia contributors may face felony indictment as well as civil charges by maintaining these materials online.

Demand is hereby made that you stop these criminal acts on the Wikipedia site, and that you remove the libelous, defamatory, false, fraudulent and misleading material that violates Wikipedia's own policies.

The page is the alleged biography page for author Patricia Cornwell, a page which appears to have been seized by partisans under Cornwell's influence or on her payroll. These partisans have authored false and fraudulent material, and reject and delete factual material that displeases Cornwell.

I am Patricia Cornwell's leading biographer, and also one of many victims of crimes committed by Cornwell.

The Wikipedia main page on Cornwell is a brief piece of pro-Cornwell propaganda, which hides and falsifies her long life of multiple scandals. A large part of the page is a libelous attack on myself, with a criminally fraudulent report of the crimes Cornwell committed against me.

As shown in court filings and public documents, Cornwell hired thugs to threaten to have me illegally jailed and murdered, and funded a fraud scheme in a Southern court to try and ban my freedom of speech. Your Wikipedia page falsifies the report of these crimes, and mounts a highly personal libelous attack against me.

Patricia Cornwell is a longtime friend of the President Bush family and some FBI agents, and has used these connections to escape prosecution for a series of crimes and offenses, clearly evident in public records and court documents.

Your Wikipedia page, seemingly written under the sway of the criminal Cornwell, hides the real facts about her life. A few words of sycophantic praise for Cornwell, and then a brief section on """"Controversies"""" which ignores her actual huge history of scandals that is evident from court records and published articles, like when Cornwell was sued for stealing the private autopsy reports of murdered children and copying them nearly verbatim into her novels.

You are invited to read Cornwell's genuine biography, widely available online, """"Patricia Cornwell Biography: Crime, Bribery, Scandal and Mental Illness"""". Researchers can already have an advance copy of my upcoming biography book on Cornwell, which extensively quotes primary sources and which can background a Wikipedia article to replace the libelous propaganda you have now.

It seems the main purpose of your current short Wikipedia Cornwell """"biography"""" page is to launch a libelous attack on myself, to try and discredit my work and my upcoming major book on Cornwell.

I have tried to begin to edit out the falsehoods and fraudulent statements in your article, but the Cornwell partisans who control the Wikipedia page immediately re-installed the pro-Cornwell lies and libelous propaganda.

The specific attacks on me in your Wikipedia article, are direct propaganda in line with Cornwell's hired thugs. Regarding the specifics of these false statements:

The article accuses me of making public """"plagiarism"""" accusations about Cornwell, regarding a book that she delayed and re-wrote after my private protests. The Wikipedia statements are false, deceptive and misleading. The Wikipedia claims are propaganda, originally laid out by the Cornwell lawyers to set up the lawsuit to ban my freedom of speech, propaganda they set out in a fraudulent article that, as documents show, was planted in the Republican Richmond Times-Dispatch newspaper by the Cornwell lawyers themselves. The Times-Dispatch is a newspaper closely tied to Patricia Cornwell, and the """"reporter"""" who wrote the fraudulent article never met me and never interviewed me.

The actual facts are that I publicly criticized neo-Nazi activities by Cornwell, her written threats advocating book-burning and the banning of free speech, and her demands that I be totally silent about her. The Cornwell lawyers have tried to pretend that the controversy was instead about accusations of """"plagiarism"""" after Cornwell already re-wrote her book, accusations they themselves fabricated to distract from the real issues.

The Wikipedia article sneers about the absence of major similarities between Cornwell's book and my earlier novel. But it does not disclose the fact that Cornwell re-wrote and revised her book substantially after my private protests over her announced stor"

Of course atheism is a religion: it attempts to answer all the big questions that other religions do, and is based on a metaphysical claim incapable of empirical proof.  But you can quibble about what """"religion"""" means all you want, because the fact remains that theistic religions and atheism are all worldviews.

Many evolutionists disagree that evolution has nothing to do with atheism.  E.g. Dawkins said that Darwmin made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist, and Provine claimed that a religion was compatible with evolution only if it was for all practical purposes indistinguishable from atheism.

I got rid of this first paragraph for several reasons:
Capitalism is typically and generally defined as an economic system where the means of production are privately owned and operated for profit; investment, pricing, and distribution decisions are privately made rather than instituted by state control, and a free market exists for goods and services.
First, """"typically"""" and """"generally"""" are weasel words.  This definition represents RJII's point of view, and violates our neutral poiint of view.  Second, I do not agree that capitalism is an economic system; there are many scholars who argue that it is not an economic system, and an NPOV description of capitalism can't make an assertion that represents one point of view.  Third, there are non-capitalist societies where the means of production are privately owned, and some scholars argue that capitalism threatens the private ownership of capital, so again this definition is inaccurate or at best violates NPOV policy.  Fourth, it is just poorly written, the second and third clauses are redundant.  Fifth, it leaves out what many consider the defining feature of capitalism, which is the commoditization of labor.

Aha! So Kayla and Kailina are the same; but there's more to be explained. After checking some more sources I think we can be sure of the existence of at least two separate Agaw dialects/languages (just like Bender 1976:8 says; but unlike Ethnologue and Sommer 1992): first, Qemant-Kemant-Chemant-Kamant-Kimantinya-Kimanteney, and secondly Kayla-Kaila-Kailinya (ethnonym Betə Israel (cf. Mann & Dalby 1987:16), xenonyms Falasha/Felasha from Ge'ez 'immigrant, stranger'; Yihudi (cf. Ethnologue 1992 as cited in Sommer 1992). Kemant could be extinct by now (Sommer 1992 mentions that """"according to Gamst, Kemant is threatened by extinction""""). In any case, a huge language shift is going on here; all speakers are bilingual in Amharic and according to Ethnologue, only 1650 native speakers of Kemant were left, out of an ethnic group of about 170,000 people in 1998. Endangered, to say the least.
Quirin (1998) leads me to believe that an important reason for Qemant and Kayla being separate languages is that their speakers (coming from a common Agaw base) developed separate identities from the beginning of the 14th century on. However, apparently there's a lot of fuss going on in Beta Israel historiography (cf. e.g. ) and I don't know enough about it at present to judge sources like this (though Qurin seems to have done his homework).
Anyway, a third dialect seems to be Qwera/Quara/Qwarina/'Kara of Kwarasa'/Hwara/Hwarasa; this one appears to be extinct (cf. Ethnologue). It seems to have been related more closely to Qemant — Gamst (p.c. to Sommer, Sommer 1992:358) proposes that """"Quara, Quarinya, spoken by a few Falasha in Quara (to the west of Qemant-land), is nearly the same language as Qemant.""""

 Stub sorting guidelines 
I sincerely believe that we really need to lay down the law in stub sorting, and really provide a guideline.  I believe that we should all attempt to reach a general consensus by April 2, 2005 in a set of rules that we can follow.  Once we have built a set of guidelines, we can formally create a policy out of those guidelines.  We need to define what a specialized topic stub is, how many articles it should cover, when is it appropriate to create it, what defines its need for its creation, what defines its need for deletion, what criteria it should follow, what are the general steps should one take when sorting a stub, whether or not to start using subst: for all templates, whether or not use subst: for all templates created by the meta-templates, and any other matters that may come up in consideration.  I thank  for initially creating the subpage for the project at Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject Stub sorting/Guidelines.  Even though they have been discussed, I feel that we really need to confirm everything.  For that, we should discuss each issue with its own sections, and raise a list of issues that we need to nail down before really continuing on.  The English Wikipedia is nearly at 500k articles.  Either the MediaWiki software needs to handle stubs such that they can be found with a simple union of categories, or the sorting is done manually by Wikipedians.  Personally, I think the latter is less taxing on the server load, especially when we use subst:, which I think would help the Wikipedia out, performance wise.  Please make your comments at Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject Stub sorting/Guidelines.  I apologize for making this somewhat of a spam notice, but since the project has more members, the project can finally decide on these important issues at hand.  (talk) 23:23, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Just delete and restore the article which is appearing more than once.

The db may be the culprit. These stubs are very heavily used and the system does seem to slow down a bit with them. Not sure why that would result in the multile template changes though.

I agree. Rather than delete material though, we should probably add to it, so we should think about writing a section about culture from an anthropological perspective. There might be material in Culture that would help.  (talk) 19:27, Apr 2, 2005 (UTC)

Unclear sections
I've removed these two paragraphs from the article as they were unclear and unreferenced. If they're to go back in, they'll need references and a rewrite. I'd have rewritten them myself, but I don't know what the first is trying to say, and the second as it stands is false, plus the Pascal quote, if it is a quote, needs a citation, and should be in the Emotions section.

The rules of scientific classification require a description of an individual specimen of the species. In 1993, Robert Bakker formally described the skull of paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope in an attempt to make Cope the type specimen for Homo sapiens. Despite current requirements that the specimen be available to the describing scientist (Cope was born in 1840 and the scientist who described and published Homo sapiens, Carolus Linnaeus, did so in 1758), it is unclear as to the lack of validity of Bakker's publication and many consider Cope to be the type specimen.

The mental ability of humans and their intelligence make them, according to Pascal, the most sad creatures of all animals. The ability to have feelings, such as sadness or happiness, distinguish them from the other organisms, even if this assertion can be hardly proved with animal tests. Humans' existence, according to most philosophers, configures itself as the search of happiness.

References
We have a short list of references in the References section, but with no indication in the text which points they were sources for; and the inline references we do have are not listed under References. I can fix the latter but not the former. Would whoever added these please say which section each of them was used as a reference for? Otherwise I'll move them to Further reading.
